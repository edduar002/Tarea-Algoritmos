AB  - The appearance and innovation of computational tools depends on human thinking and initiative, and on the other hand, human thinking is affected by computational tools. The strong function of computational tools in some aspect is superior to that of human brains. It is the application of such strong function that changes the face of human society. At the same time, it presents new methods for scientific research and new perspective for solving problems, promotes human thinking to a higher level, and presents new means for people to understand and change the world. The advantage of computational tools over human brains is the speed, while the initiative ability of human brains is not owned by computational tools. Perfect combination of thinking and computing gives birth to a series of achievements, and lays the foundation of science.

AB  - In recent years, several groups of Computer Science educators have made a sustained effort to capture the essence of CS apart from programming. Three of these approaches are Mathematical Thinking, Abstract Thinking, and Computational Thinking. Each approach tries to clarify areas of CS that are not directly tied to writing computer programs. In a separate line of research, the current authors have been examining different ways to teach mathematics to CS students. We developed a Computational Math scale that measures the level of problem-solving gestalt exhibited by textbook authors. In this study, we relate our Computational Math framework to current research on Mathematical, Abstract, and Computational (MAC) Thinking. We counted words used frequently in research articles and compared them to words that form the Computational Math scale. Our results suggest an overall MAC Thinking framework that integrates a wide range of topics relevant to computing and programming.

Blended learning may promote the developments of computational thinking on students. The paper takes the junior College students as the experimental objects, and carries a pretest-posttest study through unequal experimental and control groups. It approved that blended learning has a positive impact on the college student's computational thinking, i.e., they have an obvious progress.

Currently, there is a strong push to integrate aspects of programming and coding into the classroom environment. However, few if any tools exist that enable real-time formative assessment of in-class programming tasks. The proposed REACT (Real Time Evaluation and Assessment of Computational Thinking) system is a first step toward allowing teachers to see which high-level concepts students have mastered and which ones they are struggling with as students code in real time. REACT supports and facilitates the teaching of 21st century computing skills such as computational thinking [1] in the classroom environment.

AB  - Computational thinking assessment is an important part of testing the effectiveness of computational thinking cultivation. However, the existing computational thinking assessments still suffer from the problem of insufficient examination of non-cognitive factors, leading to the lack of validity of its assessment results. Since the iceberg model can comprehensively and deeply explore individual characteristics, this paper draws on the division idea of the model and divides computational thinking into explicit computational thinking the basic knowledge required to solve problems using computational thinking and implicit computational thinking the internal psychological characteristics of individuals in the process of using computational thinking. A comprehensive assessment framework of computational thinking is constructed, which contains five dimensions: knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, internet attitude, learning motivation, and thinking style. Finally, its application in the hierarchical teaching of computational thinking and suggestions for personalized teaching programs are given in order to promote the development of personalized education in computational thinking.

AB  - Promoting computational thinking is one of the top priorities in CS education as well as in other STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Our innovative NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational thinking with creative thinking so that students leverage their creative thinking skills to “unlock” their understanding of computational thinking. In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear “dosage” effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 – 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 = .106. These findings support our belief that the addition of creative thinking exercises to CSCE courses improves the learning of computational knowledge and skills.

AB  - Critical and computational thinking in primary and secondary education in recent years shows growing importance in methodical approaches used in the classroom. Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science. This way of using modern approaches in classroom should give teachers and pupils a broader picture of importance of interdisciplinary education for critical and computational thinking development through STEM and non-STEM classes that give pupils novel skills needed for future labor market.

AB  - Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.

AB  - As the information age has progressed, computational thinking ability to solve problems has become an indispensable way of life in life. Many scholars believe that the process of solving problems will be more logical if they have computational thinking ability. At the same time, scholars believe that a good learning method improves learners' intrinsic motivation. Therefore, in this research, we try to use conceptual mapping so that students can construct knowledge when composing their own images, as the focus of this learning model and computational thinking is the thinking process and the two coincide. This research intends to introduce the traditional programming robot course into conceptual mapping and measure whether there are differences in computational thinking tendencies, problem-solving tendencies, and intrinsic motivations between students who use conceptual mapping and those who do not use it. The students in the experimental group with conceptual mapping activities developed computational thinking skills during the program robotics course. The students in the control group first watched the computational thinking explanation video to explain the computational thinking skills to the students, and then taught in the traditional programming robotics course.

Several significant attempts have been made to increase a student's exposure to Computational Thinking at the K-12 level, however the process is complex and requires systematic planning and comprehensive curriculum. In this paper, we describe the STEPP-UP program that aims to introduce middle schoolers to Computational Thinking via Scratch and Java coding sessions. A comprehensive curriculum and hands-on activities are applied to introduce Computational Thinking for a total of 41 students for a period of five semesters from Fall 2017 until Fall 2019. To assess the learning objectives, we used three methods of evaluation; design-scenarios, paper-assessments, and learner-documentation. Findings indicate that the students have increased knowledge of Computational Thinking and its applications for problem solving.

In the whole teaching process, teachers use the way of integrating computational thinking with practical thinking to prepare courses, design tasks and guide students to complete learning tasks. Compared with the traditional teaching mode, the teaching mode of integrating computational thinking and practical thinking has made great progress in training students' computer practical ability and innovation ability. It can not only improve learning efficiency, but also train students' computer practical ability. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of this method are verified by Java Web course design.

AB  - Computational Thinking is an essential skill for all students in the 21st Century. A fundamental question is how can we create computer affordances to empower novice teachers and students, in a variety of STEM and art disciplines, to think computationally while avoiding difficult overhead emerging from traditional coding? Over the last 20 years we have iteratively developed tools that aim to support computational thinking. As these tools evolved a philosophy emerged to support Computational Thinking by joining human abilities with computer affordances. Chief among these findings is that supporting Computational Thinking is much more than making coding accessible. Computational Thinking Tools aim to minimize coding overhead by supporting users through three fundamental stages of the Computational Thinking development cycle: problem formulation, solution expression, and solution execution/evaluation.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.

AB  - Computational thinking is the process sequence of solving problems and behaves a method of systematic solving problems. Computational thinking is essentially a view of systematic information processing process. In essence, developing the computational thinking of middle school students is to improve their problem-solving ability and the corresponding practical accomplishment. The instructional activity design based on six links of problem solving can well meet the need of cultivating students’ computational thinking. The instructional mode of systematic problem solving in middle school can improve students’ learning effects and satisfaction, and promote students’ computational thinking ability significantly. The method of systematic information processing process can be trained.

AB  - A significant aspect of computational thinking is as a way of reasoning about the world in terms of data. This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction.

This study suggest a hamburger flowchart as a teaching material that combines the three elements of "unplugged", "thinking from the end " and "mathematics class". Using this flowchart, basic experiment was conducted for 8 to 12 years old. The purpose of this experiment is to confirm whether it is possible for children to develop both Computational thinking and Mathematical thinking by using the hamburger flowchart. We evaluated both Computational thinking and Mathematical thinking from the state in this class and the content of the worksheet and prior and subsequent tests. As a result, the state related to Computational thinking and Mathematical thinking increased, and the correct answer rate of many children increased from the prior test to the subsequent test. Therefore it turned out that the hamburger flowchart affects mathematical thinking.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT into educational contexts is reshaping the landscape of student learning and critical thinking. This study investigates the influence of ChatGPT on the critical thinking abilities of university students by enhancing computational strategies for analysis. We developed an advanced computational framework that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to evaluate the interaction between students and ChatGPT. Our approach involves the collection and analysis of large-scale interaction data to identify patterns and impacts on critical thinking development. We employed sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and argumentation mining to decode the nature of student responses and their evolution over time. The results reveal significant improvements in critical thinking skills among students who actively engage with ChatGPT, suggesting that the AI can act as a catalyst for developing higher-order thinking skills. This study contributes to the growing body of research on AI in education by providing insights into the mechanisms through which AI tools can enhance critical thinking, and proposes practical implications for integrating such tools into academic curricula. The findings support the notion that computational analysis can provide a nuanced understanding of AI’s educational impacts, paving the way for more effective AI-assisted learning environments.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been described as a set of valuable skills for tackling complex problems. To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.

The tools include a wide array of interactive learning environments or cognitive mini-tutors; most important among them is the Carnegie Proof Lab. The Proof Lab is a sophisticated interface for constructing natural deduction proofs and is central, as strategically guided discovery of proofs is the distinctive focus of the course. My discussion makes explicit the broader intellectual context, but also the pursuit of pedagogical goals and their experimental examination. The intellectual context includes i) the theoretical background for the proof search algorithm AProS and its use for a dynamic Proof Tutor, and ii) the programmatic expansion of the course to Computational Logic. (I recommend that the reader enter the virtual classroom of Logic & Proofs: the interactive components just cannot be properly reflected in a narrative. It is also very easy to download AProS and observe its ways of searching for proofs.) 1

It encapsulates those thinking skills integral to solving complex problems using a computer, thus widely applicable in our technological society. Several public initiatives such as the Hour of Code successfully introduced it to millions of people of different ages and backgrounds, mostly using Blocks Programming Environments like Scratch that lower the barriers of programming and facilitate learning. In this paper we present our arguments for fostering Computational Thinking skills using a Blocks Programming Environment augmented with a Tangible User Interface, namely by exploiting objects whose interactions with the physical environment are mapped to digital actions performed on the system. Our demonstration includes a working prototype implementing our Tangible Blocks Programming Environment called TAPAS.

AB  - This work-in-progress research-to-practice paper presents an intervention on integrating computational thinking modules into a software engineering course. The national consensus on the significance of computational thinking has prompted the expansion of related educational initiatives over the past decade. Since the definition of computational thinking by Wing in 2006, this concept has gained significant attention within the educational community. Particularly this surge of interest has led to extensive research into its conceptual foundations and subsequent integration into educational curricula since 2013. National initiatives have since emerged to incorporate computational thinking into the educational system. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence and computing systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing demand from industries for a workforce and graduates adept at critical thinking and problem-solving. Aligned with this national movement, our study presents a two-year institutional initiative, aimed at integrating computational thinking into the software engineering program. The software engineering discipline extensively involves design thinking and problem-solving skills. However, we noticed that these higher-level skills are not imparted early in the program to teach students this method of thinking and approaching problems. To bridge this skill gap, we developed a set of computational thinking modules and integrated them into a gateway course in the software engineering program. Over two years, we implemented this intervention in an introductory-level course and evaluated its impact on students' computational thinking skills by analyzing their responses to a standard Computational Thinking Assessment survey. The results showed significant improvement in most components. These early findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating these computational thinking modules into the gateway courses, regardless of the specific course topic. A notable feature of these modules is their adaptability to diverse engineering courses, suggesting broader applicability across disciplines. Moving forward, our research aims to expand the integration of the computational thinking modules into various courses in other institutes across the nation and analyze their impact on student performance.

AB  - Programming robots playing with the environment is an ongoing research project aimed at developing a robot and intervention program capable of enhancing young children's cognitive abilities and computational thinking skills. Using a robot sensitive to color and distance, children are able to use everyday objects in order to interact with it and program its movements. An eleven session intervention program using this robot was designed with the objective of creating playful learning instances were children would practice abilities associated with what is generally thought of as computational thinking. We'll assess children's computational thinking, fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, number recognition and magnitude comparison, vocabulary, mental rotation, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility to test for cognitive effects of the intervention. An active control in which children interact with the robot by remotely controlling it was used.

AB  - CS for ALL is a new education initiative launched in 2016 to empower a generation of American students with the computer science skills they need to thrive in a digital economy. In order to keep up with trends in the growing technology-driven world, students should have the ability to analyze and consider the consequences of computing problems critically. However, introducing CS and computational thinking skills to the first year students in college is a difficult task because the nature of the subject tends to be dry and conceptual. Thus, we introduce a computer science course that helps all undergraduate students to prepare for digital life as well as enhance their critical thinking skills through hands-on learning experiences. The course contents introduce the general concept of computer science such as computing system, basic networking, algorithms and programming with Scratch and mBot robot exercises. Our student feedback shows a high level of enthusiasm and engagement among the students. The strong hands-on learning nature of the course helped our students to have more engaging and interactive classroom experiences.

The study is based on a computational thinking competence assessment model carried out with 112 students who were given challenges and problems. The results show that: (a) the achievement levels of computational thinking competences differ significantly between the Lima group and the Amazonas group, (b) the highest levels of competence achievement are associated with students who had some level of previous instruction in secondary education, and (c) the differences in the achievement of computational thinking skills according to student gender are not significant.

AB  - During training at the Complementary Formation Program (CFP), Colombian primary school teachers do not acquire Computational Thinking (CT) skills, which are considered fundamental for the knowledge economies of the 21st century. In this paper, we describe the early stages of a project aiming to reform the CFP curriculum, such that CT skills becomes an integral part. As a first step, we carried-out four introductory workshops with 64 first-and third-semester CFP students and then surveyed them to gather their perceptions on CT. The results show that the students have a limited understanding of CT and its associated skills, but they recognize their importance. Moreover, they agree that primary school should be the starting point to develop them. The project will continue gathering information from current CFP teachers, current primary school teachers, and university professors who are experts in curriculum development, to develop the curricular proposal.

AB  - Fundamental skills acquired by undergraduate students during their academic, play a crucial role in their career. One such skill is computational thinking (CT), which will help to solve problems algorithmically using computers. Computational thinking will improve their problem solving skills in a non-conventional manner as this leads the student to think in multiple paths to reach the solution. However, it is a challenge in Computing Education to develop student's ability to solve problems in an algorithmic way. The aim of this paper is to introduce a potential and pragmatic approach to develop computational thinking skills in novices.

This study constructed a theoretical model of the impact of stem courses on students’ computational thinking, and measured the mediating effects of problem solving skills and stem attitudes on stem courses and students’ computational thinking. The study included a questionnaire of 1870 secondary school students and a descriptive, correlational and mediating analysis. The results show that stem courses can predict students’ computational thinking through students’ problem solving ability and students’ attitude towards stem. The results of this study have a positive reference value for discussing the factors affecting students’ computational thinking, implementing stem course education, improving students’ problem-solving ability and enhancing students’ attitude towards stem.

This paper describes the shortcomings of the current education of cultivating students’ computational thinking ability, analyzes the needs of cultivating students’ innovative ways of computational thinking in the information age, and expounds the necessity of innovative education and teaching. In this paper, the project driven teaching mode and the teaching method of computational thinking cultivation are proposed. The Small Private Online Course (SPOC) teaching method is used in the teaching practice, which is a kind of information technology method. Combined with project driven and SPOC teaching methods, the students' computational thinking ability is further cultivated. In the teaching practice, the information technology and project driven learning are made full use, which are two key factors in the information age, so the students’ computational thinking ability has been greatly improved, and the teaching effect is obvious.

AB  - This research study presents our work focused on studying the development of introductory computational thinking in undergraduate biomedical engineering students. In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology. This Work in Progress helps us expand our understanding of computational thinking development and the challenges involved in performing computational thinking activity in BME undergraduate students.

AB  - Observations have shown the need of adequate collaboration among the engineering educators for effective achievement of its goals. Nevertheless, there have been reports of the inadequate relationship among engineering educators. Consequently, it is vital to develop strategies to boost the synergy among the parties. Computational Thinking (CT) could be a dependable approach. This paper presents ways of ensuring synergy among engineering educators through computational thinking. A questionnaire survey that sought information from the respondents on the ways computational thinking: promotes thinking abilities, reduces personal clashes, and improves decision-making process among the engineering educators was administered to 400 respondents. 348 survey answers were returned, found reliable and used in the data analysis. The analysis revealed that computational thinking plays vital roles in the repositioning of engineering education for solving of novel problems, assurance of mutual respect among educators, and intensive research for renown engineering education with relative contribution index above 0.8. The paper recommends the development of a computational thinking based comprehensive engineering educators' synergy framework as a suggestion for future research.

AB  - The traditional information technology course focuses on the learning of programming tools and ignores the development of students' Computational Thinking. The emergence of visual programming tools provides a new opportunity for the training of Computational Thinking. On the basis of studying the limitations of thinking training in the traditional information technology class and the advantages of visual programming in computational thinking, this paper proposes a computational thinking training model based on visual programming. The model based on project adopt the combination of teaching plan and learning plan to design teaching and cultivate Computational Thinking. Applying this model to the actual teaching process by designing a teaching case based on the visual programming tool App Inventor, the experimental results show that the Computational Thinking of students in this model is improved in formalization and modeling. Through proposing this model and verifying its validity, we can provide the feasibility and research ideas for further studies by using visual programming to cultivate students' Computational Thinking.

AB  - Visual programming languages (VPLs), such as Scratch and StarLogo TNG, can make computer science education more accessible to everyone. Current researches in the study of using VPLs for educational purposes primarily focus on understanding motivational benefits and computational thinking gains. All these educational VPLs claim to scaffold students learning computational thinking concepts. Although the evaluations show that students may exhibit more enthusiasm, it is not clear what computational thinking concepts are actually learned by students. In this paper, we attempt to develop a visual programs recognition tool for student-created StarLogo TNG simulations which representing the computational thinking concepts implemented by the students. Through collecting student's created projects over time, this visual programs recognition tool can possibly indicate the patterns of computational thinking in science simulations created by StarLogo TNG.

AB  - Some curriculum of making computer games were developed to engage students in digital game-making activities so as to enhance their computational thinking skills during the last few years. The findings of those studies are quite positive, especially concerning the promotion of computational thinking skills. However, many students seem to face difficulties in the processes of the game development, such as debugging, applying mathematics, or physics subjects. Additionally, students often have solved the problems and understood concepts, mainly math formulas and physics concepts, alone while creating their games. This study presents an innovative curriculum design that suggests two students playing different role to make motion-based touchless games (i.e., games that are based on natural user interaction technologies, like the Microsoft Kinect camera or Leap Motion). Based on the requirements of the innovative curriculum and interaction technologies, students can naturally fulfill the ideal of pair programming and get various benefits from each other.

AB  - Contribution: This article proposes a new theoretical model with a goal to develop future human computational thinking (CT) in foundational computer science (CS) education. The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan.Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course.Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens.Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning.Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is a way to structure thinking to solve problems, which develops cognitive skills. Educational Digital Games (EDG) are a potential tool to work with CT, stimulating the student's interest and learning. Still, to make these games playable by children with Intellectual disabilities (ID), it is necessary to have adaptations suitable to their educational needs. Therefore, this paper presents the development and evaluation of the EDG “Pensar e Vestir” (PeV). This game addresses a daily life activity, the process of choosing clothes and the act of wearing them, and aims to promote the development of CT in children both neurotypical and with ID. The development process was supported by ID, Education, and Specialized Education Treatment specialists based on accessibility guidelines. In the end, there were two evaluations, firstly with the specialists and then with Computation students, to validate the functional and technical requirements. Currently, the game is in evaluation by its target audience.

AB  - This paper is focused on the teaching/learning process of Computational Thinking at primary and secondary schools. It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.

AB  - Recent trends in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education are focused on developing problem-solving skills and computational thinking and empowering students with the STEM discipline's knowledge to solve real-world problems. STEM incorporates an interdisciplinary approach that includes inquiry, analysis, critical thinking, practical experimentation, and cooperative problem-solving. Technological advancements are offering new ways to integrate new tools such as drones, robotics and gaming in teaching and learning practices and modify the pedagogical approaches that are more appealing and engaging. This paper presents an innovative pedagogical approach and practice that integrate drone technology and block-based programming to foster students' computation thinking in a STEM context. The block-based visual programming languages provide an interactive environment to connect the blocks and write programs. The study was conducted in six Australian schools. Students were assigned projects to automate drones using the DroneBlocks app and make programs to fly the drone in different geometrical patterns; straight line, arch, rectangle, triangles and zig-zag and integrate the various manoeuvres; bounce, 8D flips, and throw & go along flight paths. Students' computational thinking development was examined with an emphasis on their performance in formulating and problem-solving. Results have shown that integrated drone and programming pedagogy contributed significantly to students' learning of developing computational thinking for problem-solving and decomposing a problem into smaller parts in a sequence that includes mathematical algorithms to write programs.

AB  - Gender differences in computational thinking (CT) among students are obvious, with boys ‘CT being significantly higher than girls’. Therefore, how to effectively improve girls' CT has become a serious concern. This study integrated two types of project-based learning (PBL) into a Scratch programming course, one with extensive teacher-supported scaffolding and the other with limited teacher-supported scaffolding. To examine their impact on girls' CT skills and self-efficacy, this study applied mixed research methods, conducted a pretest-posttest control group experiment, and analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data collected from 21 grade-3 girls in a primary school. It was found that the extensive teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL in a Scratch programming course is more effective in promoting the CT skills and self-efficacy than limited teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL. These findings have some implications for the effective PBL practice and related teacher professional development.

Traditional teaching approaches for CT and ST offer limited avenues for applying the knowledge and skills learned in class. This paper presents and discusses the design and development of intelligent aquaponics capstone projects to foster CT and ST in undergraduate students. Specifically, students designed and built an automated aquaponics system with internet of things for real-time remote monitoring and control. Aquaculture and hydroponics subsystems, hardware and software components, communication networks, and data acquisition and analysis of fish and plant growth were integrated and tested, with high yield and quality of fish and vegetables. Attributable to the multidisciplinary and multifaceted high-tech aquaponics system, students can broaden and deepen their theoretical understanding and practical experience of CT and ST.

AB  - To better understand the impact of students' personality on their computational thinking (CT), this paper develops a CT evaluation tool for college students. Correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between students' computational thinking skills (CTS) and their five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 219 college students completed the CT Assessment Test and the Big Five Personality Inventory. The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that teachers can pay attention to the individual differences of students from the perspective of personality, and provide them with suitable education to comprehensively improve students' CTS.

AB  - Learning to program is the new literacy of the 21st century. Computational thinking, closely related to programming, requires thinking and solving problems with different levels of abstraction and is independent of hardware devices. The early childhood education stage provides teachers with the opportunity to lay the foundations for a comprehensive quality education using innovative tools and technologies. Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner. Moreover, the lack of diversity and inequality is particularly latent in science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Therefore, this work considers this problem and presents an inclusive coeducation approach to this new literacy, eliminating gender stereotypes and extending them to people with Down syndrome and hospitalized minors.

AB  - The computational thinking view recognizes that underlying computing concepts are integral to our everyday lives and pervasive in many disciplines of study. Computer science, information systems, computer engineering, informatics, software engineering-these are among the smorgasbord of choices available to college students interested in a computing career. The choices for noncomputing-oriented students who want to learn about the field are even more confounding. Indeed, the established term "computer science" is not well-defined or well understood, leading to further confusion for students and their parents as well as the general public. These are some factors I view as contributing to the drop in interest in the study of computer science. The student should learn the fundamental concept of computer sciences. Computing education has been too slow moving from the computing = programming model to a more general and understandable model that captures the essence of the discipline for everyone.

AB  - This paper introduces the notion of predicting academic performance based on Computational Thinking. The integral role that Computational Thinking modalities play in engineering disciplines can serve as an accurate indicator of the student future academic success. Therefore, this study investigated the students' performance in a Computational Thinking course offered at the freshman level to predict student academic success. To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success. These results have also implied that the assessment of Computational Thinking can be used as an early intervention tool to improve the students' retention, progression, and graduation rates in STEM related disciplines.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted traditional teaching methods in schools, and blended teaching in the post-pandemic has gradually become a hot topic of research in higher education. Computational thinking, as one of the core literacies to be acquired in the 21st century, can help students realize the importance of computers as well as enable them to solve specific problems more effectively when facing real-life situations. The article takes the C language programming course as an example, analyzes the problems faced in teaching in the post-pandemic, introduces the concept of computational thinking and integrates it into all aspects of blended teaching design, pays attention to students' individual differences, and proposes a blended teaching model based on computational thinking and puts it into practice. The results show that this teaching model can improve students' learning performance, exercise students' computational thinking skills, and promote blended teaching reform and students' personalized development.

AB  - Computational thinking is a type of analytical thinking that is developed intentionally, that is, under a “learned” approach, and the best way to learn it is through computer programming. In this paper, the experience of using block-based programming environments such as Scratch, Lightbot and the PSelnt pseudo-code tool for the understanding of computational concepts and development of computational thinking skills is reported. A quasi-experimental methodological design was used, since it did not work with a control group. A mixed exploratory investigation was carried out. 85 first-year students from the Accounting Professional School of the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa participated in the experience. The results show that in introductory programming courses of short time period, teaching with block-based programming environments compared to the use of pseudocode with the PSelnt tool, facilitates the appropriation of computational concepts and the development of computational thinking skills; thus obtaining better learning results. It is concluded that block-based programming environments favor the construction of knowledge and foster the development of creativity and algorithmic thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming increasingly relevant for future professionals across all domains, beyond computer science (CS). As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.

AB  - Programming is considered a skill to arouse and inspire learner's potential. Learning to program is a complex process that requires students to write grammar and instructions. The structure of a programming language does not cause impose problems to students, the real obstacle is how to apply these learned grammars and present them in a complete and correct program code for problem solving. In this study, a deep learning recommendation system was developed, which includes augmented reality (AR) technology, and learning theory, and is provided for study by students in non-major and also from different learning backgrounds. Those students divided into two groups, the students participating in the experimental group were using the AR system with deep learning recommendation and the students participating in the control group were using the AR system without deep learning recommendation. The results show that students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to learning achievement. On the other hand, in the part of computational thinking ability, students using a deep learning recommendation based AR system is significantly better than those using non-deep learning recommendation based AR system. Among the various dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills are significantly different among the two groups of students. The students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to the dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

AB  - Computational thinking is an important concept that is widely concerned by international computer community, and it is considered as an important way to carry out university computer education reform. This paper firstly analyzes the existing problems in university computer teaching for non-computer majors, and then it discusses a series of teaching practices that integrate computational thinking into university computer teaching, including: (1) Students are divided into different classes according to their computer proficiency; (2) We abandon the concept of “Narrow Instrumentalism”, and teach the most essential knowledge of computer foundation; (3) We propose the “data” as the mainline, and then reconstruct teaching content according to the mainline; (4) We also reconstruct experimental content with the mainline, and separate experimental teaching into a single course. The practices has proved that the teaching methods put forward in this paper yield good results, and it provides a new model for University Computer Foundation teaching, which aims at improving students’ computational thinking.

AB  - The study aims to examine the effectiveness of flipped-classroom instruction on college students’ computational thinking skills (CTS). Participants were enrolled in the basic computer course from two classes at a university in central China. One class as an experimental group was chosen for the flipped-classroom instruction method (n=55); the other as a control group used the traditional lecture-based instruction method (n=54). The results show that learning through the flipped-classroom approach can significantly promote students’ levels of creativity, algorithmic thinking, cooperativity, and critical thinking, compared with the traditional lecture-based instruction approach. The findings of this research suggest that instructors should be encouraged to take the flipped-classroom instruction method to teach.

AB  - Computational thinking is a crucial skill for students to analyze and solve problems, and programming education serves as an important pathway to cultivate computational thinking. This study combines relevant literature and utilizes Scratch, a visual programming software, to construct a gamified teaching model for Scratch courses. A quasi-experimental research design was employed, involving two fifth-grade classes from a primary school in K city. The study employed methods such as analysis of student works, SPSS scale data analysis, and student interviews to investigate the impact of gamified teaching in Scratch courses on developing elementary students' computational thinking. The results indicate that gamified teaching in Scratch courses significantly enhances the computational thinking level of elementary students, particularly in the dimensions of critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and algorithmic thinking. Based on the research findings, it is recommended that gamified teaching in Scratch courses should involve appropriate teaching tools, incorporate game-based learning, emphasize problem-solving, encourage collaborative learning, and provide training for educators competent in programming education.

The target problem is the lack of a robust, scalable, and automated method to analyze computational thinking skills from source code written by elementary school students. The proposed method uses a variety of techniques to assess student responses, including analyzing the programming structure, programming correctness, and code execution based on certain parameters defined during the exercise specification. Analysis of the source code and evaluation of the answers to the exercises are carried out using high performance computing to improve the response time of the system. This preliminary work will contribute to a robust method for automated exam scoring, which is expected to assess and support the development of computational thinking among students.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) gained significant importance in education, leading to a surge in the development of dedicated instructional platforms. The cultivation of students’ CT skills posed a challenge, often involving the introduction of abstract and challenging-to-visualize programming concepts. This study aimed to bridge this gap by introducing an augmented reality-based coding game—an interactive learning platform designed to facilitate students in acquiring programming skills and enhancing their grasp of computational thinking concepts. The augmented reality (AR) digital game is specifically directed towards fundamental CT skills, such as pattern recognition, decomposition, abstraction, and developing algorithms. To evaluate the effectiveness of the AR game in enhancing CT skills, a study was conducted with 124 middle school students, entailing in grades 6th and 8th. The experimental group (N = 63) utilized the AR game, while the control group (N = 61) relied on conventional text materials. The findings of the experiment strongly supported the integration of AR technology along with game-based learning as a means to enhance CT knowledge and skills while simultaneously reducing cognitive load.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is a method of analysis and problem solving that enables the development of life skills and positively influences the social and competitive conditions of people. This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts. In addition, PC contributes to the formation of critical thinking, creativity and cooperation between people. In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners’ skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises. This paper presents the joint research between the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC) and the PRONIE MEP-FOD program of the Omar Dengo Foundation. Its objective is to automatically analyze the source code created by the students, evaluate the Computational Thinking skills they developed and compare the results with the learning objectives established in the study plans.

AB  - Computational thinking is an important skill for solving complex problems, including processes such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic design. Game-based learning has recently seen an increase in prevalence for teaching computational thinking, making games an important topic of study. However, there is currently no validated tool for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) that performs reliably across disciplines and age groups. In the absence of such a tool, this paper examines several software testing methods for the evaluation of CT pedagogy effectiveness within serious games. Namely, it makes recommendations for the application of standardized questionnaires, think-aloud testing, and automated data logging for evaluating games that promote CT learning. It concludes with a potential use case to demonstrate how the methods can be combined to achieve a granular and actionable understanding of a complex CT assessment problem and its causes.

AB  - Computational thinking is the third major mode of thinking in the age of artificial intelligence. Many primary and secondary schools adopt graphical programming as an important way for students' computational thinking development. However, elementary school students have less self-control in learning and are more dependent on teachers, so timely and effective teaching interaction is an important guarantee for the realization of the teaching goals of graphical programming. Through three rounds of action research, the essay investigated the impact of teaching interaction strategies on the development of students' computational thinking. The findings show that students are satisfied with the designed interaction strategies, and the interaction strategies can significantly improve students' computational thinking ability and level.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to design a computational thinking curriculum standard for K-12 education. The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields. The results serve as useful references for developing Taiwan's new K-12 computing curriculum.

AB  - Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education are widely favored by schools and teachers because both of them are student-centered learning models by allowing students to collaborate and explore around issues in order to promote the development of students' learning in the 21st century. However, in practical pedagogical applications, specific educational models and implementations are highly dependent on exceptional teachers with innovative abilities, especially in the cultivation of implicit higher-order thinking of students still lacking a better landing point. In the context of the current era of rapid development of information technology, the educational changes caused by the new development of smart education mean that more attention should be paid to the level of thinking and operational skills of students. As a result, the Problem-Based Learning for Computational Thinking Development Model for Primary and Secondary Schools (CTPBL), which is interdisciplinary, contextual, innovative, experiential and humanistic in nature, has emerged. As a new educational model, CTPBL helps integrate the advantages of existing Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education, crack the dilemma of teachers' choice of the inherent educational model, and realize the cultivation of students' information literacy and the improvement of their comprehensive ability. However, it still needs to be further explored, such as its operation mechanism, technology carrier, and teachers' roles.

AB  - Building a classroom environment based on student-led, meaningful collaboration is an ideal being promoted by educators and administrators seeking to equip students with 21st century workforce skills. More and more often, teachers are challenged to design lessons that utilize students' innate desire to communicate with one another rather than more traditional direct instruction. With a heavy focus on student-driven instruction and a reduced role for direct instruction, Carson Middle School's Game Design I course is able to utilize collaboration as a means for allowing students to not only learn but master and retain Computational Thinking Patterns and apply them in formal summative assessments. Through the collection of these data points throughout the course of a semester of learning, an educator can fully appreciate the learning of Computational Thinking skills that occurs as students build a sequence of games and simulations.

AB  - Educational robots have been used in schools for STEM education and for teaching students programming and computational thinking (CT) for many years. The look and feel of traditional robots for educational purposes such as LEGO Mindstorms and NXT have been mostly engineering-oriented. Not until recently, have robotic products such as Dash & Dot utilized physical appearance which were cute and kid-friendly. This study compared the effects of using two kinds of robots- Dash & Dot and LEGO NXT, in terms of students' performance, student's attitudes about learning activities, and how different genders respond to various robots. A Quasi-Experimental Design was conducted. The participants consisted of 106 6th graders from four classes of students. Two classes were designated as the experimental groups which used Dash & Dot robots,). The other two classes of students were the control groups which used NXT robots. With respect to students' attitudes toward learning, the study showed no significant difference between experimental and control groups. With respect to learning programming skills, it was found that females in the experimental group prefer to use robots. Females showed a definite preference for using the Dash & Dot robots.

AB  - The call for innovative talents in the information age is imminent. With the promulgation of the domestic high school information technology curriculum standards in 2017, the formulation and positioning requirements of the core literacy of the disciplines, computational thinking as one of the four core literacy, is the thinking ability that everyone should have. Many foreign educational practice studies have shown that mind mapping can effectively promote students' cognitive development and knowledge construction. However, the domestic educational application research is relatively lacking in this aspect, and there is little research on the comprehensive and in-depth combination of it and the core literacy “computational thinking” of the specific information technology discipline. To this end, based on the research status at home and abroad, this paper attempts to use the concept map tool to represent several important functions of computational thinking, "definition of problems", "abstract function", "build model" and "Debugging and improvement". The diagram incorporates the teaching model in the computational thinking development curriculum. This study used quasi-experimental research methods to explore the effect of conceptual map tools on students' computational thinking. The research results show that this teaching method has a significant effect on the development of students' computational thinking.

AB  - Contribution: This study represents the first systematic attempt to develop Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) integrated project-based learning (PBL) as a transdisciplinary teaching method for fostering students’ creativity and computational thinking (CT) skills. Background: With the growing importance of creativity and CT skills in the modern world, there is a need for innovative teaching methods that can effectively nurture these abilities in students. This study explores the potential of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach to address this need. Intended Outcomes: The outcomes of this approach include significant improvements in various dimensions of students’ creativity (fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration) and enhanced CT skills, particularly in medium and hard tasks. Application Design: The study involved 54 junior high school seventh-graders, with 28 students in the experimental group and 26 students in the comparison group. The experimental group was exposed to a semester of STEAM PBL, while the comparison group followed the regular curriculum. Findings: After a semester of STEAM PBL, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in creativity dimensions, while the comparison group showed no significant changes. In terms of CT skills, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in medium and hard tasks, whereas the comparison group did not. These results highlight the potential benefits of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach for enhancing students’ creativity and CT skills. The implications for educational practice and future research are discussed in depth.

AB  - This study attempted to investigate elementary school teachers' understandings, beliefs, and intentions toward STEM and Computational Thinking. We collected data through a survey of 16 teachers at one elementary school in Malang City, Indonesia. They represented a variety of subjects with diverse learning experiences. The survey took place after the respondents received a short training about STEM and Computational Thinking. Quantitative analysis showed that most elementary school teachers positively demonstrated Computational Thinking practices in their schools. Besides, they believed that Computational Thinking could help students think logically, structurally, and creatively, while STEM helped train students to be problem solvers in an analytical, critical, and practical way. In addition, most respondents intended to continue learning and applying STEM and Computational Thinking approaches in their learning design. Added to this, the participants' understanding of STEM and Computational Thinking also improved based on the results of the Wilcoxon test conducted on the pre-test and post-test. This study provides valuable information on the need for elementary teacher development programs, namely improving teachers' teaching skills based on STEM and Computational Thinking for preparing students with 21 st-century learning skills.

AB  - Promoting computational thinking is a priority in CS education and other STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Our innovative, NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational and creative thinking. In Spring 2013, we deployed Computational Creativity Exercises (CCE) designed to engage creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in an introductory CSI course for engineering students. We compared this CCE implementation semester (80 students, 95% completing 3 or 4 CCEs) to the Fall 2013 semester of the same course (55 students) without CCEs. CCE implementation students had significantly higher scores on a CS concepts and skills knowledge test (F(1, 132) = 7.72, p < 01, partial Eta2 = .055; M=7.47 to M=6.13; 13 items) and significantly higher self-efficacy for applying CS knowledge in their field (F(1, 153) = 12.22, p < .01, partial Eta2 = .074; M=70.64 to M=61.47; 100-point scale). CCE implementation students had significantly higher study time (t(1, 136) = 2.08, p = .04; M=3.88 to M=3.29; 7-point scale) and significantly lower lack of regulation, which measures difficulties with studying (t(1, 136) = 2.82, p = .006; M=2.80 to M=3.21; 5-point scale). The addition of computational creativity exercises to CS courses may improve computational thinking and learning of CS knowledge and skills.

AB  - The primary objective of this research was to investigate effective learning sequences starting with computational thinking, programming, or both. We experimented with and analyzed the learning sequence of students from the Department of Computer Engineering, Information Management, and Mechanical Engineering. The findings indicated that the students of the Department of Computer Engineering possessed prior experiences in programming or computational thinking. Their learning sequences limitedly impacted learning outcomes. Conversely, for the students of the Department of Information Management, learning computational thinking before programming did not result in better learning outcomes, emphasizing the need for coherence in courses. The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses. Thus, it is required to maintain cross-course coherence and establish links between computational thinking and programming skills to offer a more in-depth learning experience.

AB  - This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.

AB  - Critical thinking is one of the core missions of higher education. It emphasizes self-reflection and critical examination. There are few proven methods to teach critical thinking effectively, and assessment of students' thinking skills often fell short. Most universities do not teach critical thinking in a cohesive and systematic fashion after the students enter a specific discipline, such as management or engineering. This paper proposes to design a discipline specific critical thinking curriculum by adopting a Problem Solving Life Cycle framework. Critical thinking skills are reinforced in every phase throughout the Life Cycle with documented deliverables and assessment criteria.

AB  - Existing literature presents many cases of computational thinking analysis through the perspective of a skill set for 21st century. However it is important to go deeper and understand how computational thinking activities fosters the cognitive development of the young, especially if we want them to have “a significant advantage in problem solving”, becoming innovative thinkers [1]. To be innovative it is necessary that a person use sophisticated cognitive structures to reason over abstractions and deal with hypothesis. These are the characteristics of the formal operational thinking [2]. Therefore, this paper is about the use of formal thinking on computational thinking activities over a digital fabrication project developed in a Brazilian makerspace (POALab FabLab). Using a Case Study we want to show that computational thinking and digital fabrication projects demand the use of formal thinking and, since that, the importance of designing learning activities for makerspaces taking in mind the possibilities of cognitive development.

AB  - The essence of computational thinking is thinking about data and ideas, and using and combining these resources to solve problems. The internal requirement of the programming courses is to cultivate the student's the ability to use programming language for problem analysis and problem solving. According to the characteristics of the courses themselves, this paper proposes a course teaching system built on the core of computational thinking ability cultivation and related reform method, which emphasizes the problem solving and algorithm design and determines the relationship between object-oriented method and procedure-oriented method in theoretical teaching, and designs multi-layer experiments and project-based experiment organization. This teaching strategy proves effective through teaching practice.

AB  - While in the workplace are highly demanded work-related awareness of computing and information technology, this discipline does not have sufficient and accurate dissemination, especially in schools. New technologies have positioned more as a communication tool than as a means for building innovative products. On the other hand, it has missed the application of own abilities in the area, such as the development of logical reasoning, algorithmic thinking and problem solving, both the school curriculum as well as in instances of informal learning of students. In literature and on the web, there are tools that are accessible by both self-study students to be used as a complement to other activities. However, these tools seek the development of computational thinking itself, and not within a broader framework, which allows to present the computer science as an area of professional development, for example, inserted in a context where should solve problems requiring support programming and algorithms. Problock is proposed as a tool to (1) develop computational thinking, in a context of learning based on addiction problems, (2) disseminate and motivate students for future professional development in higher education in computer science and disciplines related. In this paper, the results of the construction of the tool are presented and the work in progress in a Chilean school.

AB  - With the coming of the digital intelligence era, contemporary middle school students should have the key literacy and ability to quickly adapt to the current social development. Computational thinking, as a critical problem-solving skill in the era of artificial intelligence, has also become a basic literacy for students to face the future. However, the traditional “duck and filler” teaching mode is ineffective in developing computational thinking skills, while the gamified learning approach allows learners to interact with games in an immersive way. Therefore, this study combines games and programming teaching, builds a teaching model of gamified text programming, and develops a series of programming courses. It can develop not only computational thinking skills and improve students' programming ability but also effectively avoid the limitations of traditional programming teaching.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) term came into extensive use as an accepted term in recent years between practitioners and researchers in the educational field. It was predicted that CT would be a primary ability which would harmonize reading, writing and arithmetic intended for Science Technology Engineering and Medicine (STEM) students and educators to sustain scientific revolution. The incorporation at earlier stages of CT and related concepts to students' education has gained significance and is paramount evidenced by the changes in policy, curriculum and practice. This work deals with the computational education considerations for the Freshman Engineering Course learners, a step further than teaching with programming and employing CT elements for enhancing student's problem-solving abilities and logical thoughts which benefit to a great extent throughout the student's learning expedition. Finally, the outcomes achieved have been presented and suggesting what should be done on bringing computational thinking into classes

Using C program language as example, this paper discusses how to train thinking capability of students during the programming language teaching. Computer programming languages have the features of mass content and practical techniques, and it is difficult for students to master one in short period of time. We provide some advices about how to organize the teaching content and experiments are proposed for improving the teaching results, and human thinking characters are exploited for increasing creative capability. The teaching methods proposed have proved effective for training thinking capability of students.

The methodological proposal includes specific tasks or activities to develop computational thinking as well as tests that allow analyzing the extent to which computational thinking or skills related to problem solving have been developed in a scientific, specific, or even general or of practical application in situations of daily life. Once the methodological framework was defined, we proceeded to develop a computer tool that provides global support for the implementation of this methodology. The implemented platform has a simple and intuitive design that allows an easy use of it since it is aimed at pre-university students and teachers who necessarily do not have advanced knowledge of Computer Science. Finally, the platform automatically provides progress reports and course development, including statistical data by age or gender, among others.

AB  - Nowadays, the ability to code is becoming increasingly important in industry and is often mentioned as a crucial skill for future employment. In maker culture, the ability to program along with other technical skills often exceeds this limitation and also includes fun activities through personally fabricated projects. In this paper, we examine computational design projects that are intended to be 3D printed and could potentially introduce coding learning actions. To find computationally rich designs that are appealing to learners, we conducted data analysis on an online makerspace which exploits computational design tools for personal fabrication. We found the most liked designs of the online makerspace and examined which of them included programming features (iterations, conditional statements and functions/modules) and could foster computational thinking elements such as abstract and algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and decomposition. The most liked category of designs was Figures (of animals and popular animation characters among other things) which surprisingly often also included programming features. We discuss the implications of our research for technologists, academics and teachers who wish to include 3D modeling and printing in coding learning activities.

AB  - For the last two decades, the world of pre-academic and academic education has been occupied with ways of developing computational thinking. Responding to the common perception to develop those thinking skills in all learners, and indeed in the entire population, we developed a MOOC on computational thinking. The course advocates the development of computational thinking skills in every human being, at any age, and in any subject matter, emphasizing the common, essential computational thinking skills: problem decomposition, abstraction, and generalization. Based on our belief in the importance of the application of computational thinking skills when using computerized environments, and the importance of its significant application in developing an understanding of any discipline, the course is based on the development of simulations of computational processes in any area of knowledge. We widely discuss the pedagogical challenges of developing a MOOC on thinking skills without teacher-learner interaction, and share how we overcame these challenges by implementing the Four Pedagogies for Developing Computational Thinking (4P4CT) framework, which integrates the pedagogies of active learning, project-based learning, product-based learning, and context-based learning. We present preliminary findings from research we conducted during the first two MOOC cycles with about 1,600 learners. Specifically, quantitative and qualitative data analysis of students' learning processes are discussed, reflecting the students' multi-faceted and deep engagement in the MOOC.

AB  - The rise of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the increasing reliance on the digital economy drive the need for a new set of skills, especially in robotics learning, that includes computational thinking (CT) and adversarial thinking (AT) for the young generation. The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.

AB  - Block-oriented programming environments, such as Scratch and AppInventor, have become mainstream and have helped introduce non-programmers to algorithmic thinking; that is, to computational thinking (CT) skills. In various experiments, referenced in this paper, we observed how objects (tangibles) augmented with digital properties - that is, tangible user interface (TUI) objects - can help develop CT skills. We investigate which paradigm can be used to introduce CT skills with TUIs. By drawing on past experience, we conclude that block-oriented programming provides a suitable answer to our research questions. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for implementing block-oriented programmable objects that we believe can help end-users learn CT skills.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received increasing attention from educational researchers as a higher-order thinking skill. CT is a key factor that influences the learning process and facilitates the acquisition of knowledge and the improvement of students’ academic performance. However, the mechanisms of how CT affects students’ academic performance have yet to be explored in depth. Based on this, this study used a large-scale questionnaire to construct a model with problem-solving ability and learning anxiety as mediators with 8,134 Chinese elementary school students. The results showed that CT was a significant direct predictor of academic achievement; problem-solving ability and learning anxiety played significant mediator roles between CT and students’ academic achievement. CT can improve students’ problem-solving ability and reduce anxiety, which leads to better academic performance.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) concept is a problem-solving approach that includes logical ordering, analyzing data and preparing solutions with the help of different visualization tools like flowcharts, graphs, pie charts etc. CT is not just used by computer programmer, but it can also be used by students and teachers in any classroom so that teaching learning process becomes successful. CT is an important element for the expansion of computer software, along with providing the huge support to problem solving skills across all disciplines of education like engineering, science, humanities and K12 education. It gives a logical idea to the students to solve a problem systematically using algorithm development, flowchart design and programming and problem-solving skills. CT increases the confidence among students in dealing with complexity of difficult problems, the capacity to handle complex issues and collaborate with others to find a shared purpose or solution. In this research paper, authors discuss the impact of CT among the students of different specialization of engineering and K12 by using different problem-solving techniques and strategies such as modeling, making sub goals, pruning and searching so that students will be able to think differently towards new problems.

Traditional teaching can no longer meet the needs of modern education, and the teaching reform of information technology courses is imperative. Therefore, this article proposes to apply gamification teaching to information technology courses to increase students’ interest in learning and cultivate students’ computational thinking, that is, the ability to use the basic concepts of computer science to solve complex problems. This article takes the secondary vocational information technology course as an example to study the specific application of gamification teaching, and proposes a case of “Gobang Game” to provide a reference for the implementation of gamification teaching.

AB  - This research-to-practice full paper describes K-12 Diversity and Broadening Participation through the integration of Computational Thinking (CT) across the curriculum. CT is implicit within the current high school curriculum and used by teachers and students every day in their classrooms across multiple content areas. Most students are unaware they are using these skills and that these skills are the foundation of learning computer science. Over a series of workshops, high school teachers and students, and university faculty discussed the need to incorporate CT skills throughout the high school curriculum to improve those skills in students and to impart a better understanding of computer science. The result was a guide created to assist high school teachers to make CT concepts explicit in their classes. A main component of the guide includes specific examples of how to incorporate CT skills in various content areas. The guide was created on a foundation of cultural relevance and cogenerative dialogues. Here we describe salient points about the creation of the guide and insights gained during these workshops.

AB  - This paper, based on findings in brain organization and cognitive neuroscience, proposed a more low-level and plausible architecture of human cognition, called CAUT, which can demonstrate the diagram and mechanism of human thinking. Comparing with existing models, three changes are made: (1) a pathway called inner loop is added from motor controller to thalamus; (2) a memory controller is added in front of long-term declarative memory, which can judge whether the memory operation is retrieval or not; (3) two new modules, Active Object buffer (AO) and Active Action buffer, are separated out of the general working memory model. With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted. Experiments with ACT-R indicate that CAUT is consistent with ACT-R in functional level, and the description can be easily transformed into ACT-R model, and CAUT architecture can be taken as a meta-description and design tool to construct cognitive model. Experiments with ACT-R also indicate the effectiveness of CAUT architecture.

AB  - Self-efficacy is critical for improving computational thinking in gaming. However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.

We review the theoretical background and demonstrate the basis upon which an interactive counterpart can be achieved in supporting the cognitive capabilities of the designer, such as visual thinking. The approach is elaborated and illustrated by experimental work in the area of conceptual design. We define three phenomena related to visual thinking in design which are characteristic of conceptual design: ideation, re-representation, and the evocation of generic representations. Finally, we demonstrate through examples how interactive computational environments can support these cognitive design phenomena.

However, the current learning content of STEAM almost focuses on the learning of STEM subjects and the cultivation of the Computational Thinking (CT), so the learning of ART subject is insufficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a Scheme of STEAM Interactive Learning Toy for Musical Thinking (MT) and Computational Thinking (ILT-MCT), to engage primary level elementary students in learning knowledge and concepts of the MT and CT both. In ILT-MCT scheme, children read the paper-based learning content (learning book) to learn the concepts of MT and CT, interact with a Mobile-based learning toy using substantial Programming Blocks, and further play the digital game-based learning content via the learning toy to enhance the learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), one of the 21st-century essential competencies, has been broadly accepted by artificial intelligence (AI) and STEM. However, little was conducted to explore its potential in foreign language (FL) learning and teaching. To examine its possibilities, the relevant challenges, computer-language input and output process, and literature shreds of evidence were offered and analyzed. English grammar learning and teaching practice based on CT principal skills steps-focused mode further confirmed its social mediation tool in English learning and teaching.

AB  - Maths is presently regarded as the key driver that underpins Science, Education and Technology (SET) skills. In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.

AB  - The use of video scenarios is an active learning approach designed to aid in the development of computational and entrepreneurial thinking skills. Video scenarios present problems in the context of lifelike settings in order to emphasize the complexity as well as creative potential presented by problems which are diverse, multi-layered and frequently ill-defined. Students must carefully observe and critically listen to the characters in the videos in order to understand the problems they are experiencing. Through discussion, design or implementation, students explore potential ways in which computing can be used to help the characters solve their problems. The approach is designed to develop creative problem solving skills, while also encouraging students to view themselves as capable of entrepreneurship and innovation in computing. The videos are freely available on the website www.virt-u.org, and can be used for a wide range of learning activities.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to look at how a music programming course affects the development of computational thinking in undergraduate music conservatory students. In addition to teaching the fundamentals of computational thinking, music programming, and logic, the course addresses the Four C’s of education. The change in students’ attitudes toward computer and algorithmic skills, creativity, communication, and collaboration is measured using a pre- and post-test experimental design. Additionally, computational thinking abilities are assessed through the administration of music analysis, procedural, graphical, and logic quizzes, while creativity is evaluated through a qualitative grading of the students’ final music projects. Results show a general perceived improvement of the students’ attitudes toward the Four C’s as well as a good ability to convert learned computational models into musical creativity. However, more effort is needed in order to guarantee an overall improvement in the students’ actual computational thinking abilities.

AB  - With the development of the era of artificial intelligence(AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking(CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice, and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of the CT perspective can promote the growth of students ‘ connection ability, questioning ability, and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ‘ CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students' computational identity.

AB  - For students majored in computer science, the ability to have computational thinking is an essential skill. Facilitating computational thinking cannot only help students understand the professional knowledge and principles of computer, but also bring new ideas to addressing complex problems, therefore, many colleges and universities have carried out computer professional curriculum reform based on computational thinking. Due to the high degree of abstraction of computational thinking, traditional teaching methods will cause students to understand computational thinking only at the conceptual level, and cannot realize the flexible use of computational thinking concepts. This study takes the software engineering course as an example to explain how to integrate the concepts of computational thinking into the original courses. The goal is to enable students to understand software engineering contents problems from the perspective of problem-solving.

AB  - Contribution: This document presents a systematic bibliographic review that demonstrates the need to conduct research on how the user experience impacts the development of computational thinking. Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.

AB  - With the introduction of computer programming in schools around the world, Scratch has risen in prominence for its thinkable, meaningful and social. Aiming to assessing the Computational Thinking skills of a Scratch program, we design and implement a new Scratch program analysis tool based on ANTLR. To solve some flaws (e.g., high failure rate and low efficiency) in Dr. Scratch which is the most relevant tool to assess Computational Thinking skills of Scratch programs, we choose the recognition tool ANTLR to design the system module and the assessing flow. And then, we customize more than 200 lexical and syntax parser rules in ANTLR. Furthermore, we expand the grading standard of assessing Computational Thinking skills in Dr. Scratch. Some fundamental concepts in Computer Science, such as stack, queue and recursion method, are involved in our grading standard. Experiment results show the performance (e.g., success rate, execution time) of SAT is superior to that of Dr. Scratch.

AB  - In recent years, engineering education has become one of the challenging issues in Thailand education. By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities.

AB  - Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.

AB  - Computational thinking is the systematic approach of defining a problem and crafting its solution. It employs computer programming algorithms to address scientific, engineering, and mathematical challenges using programming languages. Feedback plays a pivotal role in the learning journey of computational thinking. It is widely recognized that offering timely feedback to students on their computational endeavors significantly contributes to their achievement and overall satisfaction with the course. This research explores the implementation of an automated feedback system designed to evaluate and offer early feedback on computer engineering projects. The aim is to integrate best practices and software tools related to computational thinking into the thinking and learning processes within an engineering curriculum. Preliminary findings suggest that the automated feedback system enhances students' computational skills and improves their performance in the course. We anticipate that the insights gained from this research will inform the enhancement of curricula and course evaluations across different computational thinking tasks, disciplines, and courses.

AB  - This Work-in-Progress study focuses on computational thinking (CT) in children. Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are currently underrepresented in STEM education and careers. However, providing appropriate early CT learning opportunities can potentially help learners develop both interest and self-efficacy in computer science and STEM fields.Our research aims to characterize computational thinking and engineering thinking for K-2 aged children. In this paper, we report on our findings of children exploring a recently installed exhibit at a local Midwestern science center. The exhibit was designed to help children learn about engineering careers and CT, and provides different learning activities to elicit CT in children from diverse learning groups. The exhibit provides information about different engineering disciplines/fields, and examples of engineers from diverse groups (i.e. it includes images of people of different races, ethnicities, gender, and ability).In this study, we audio- and video-recorded families while they explored the exhibit. They then participated in interviews and completed surveys. The video data provided evidence that children can engage in a range of CT competencies in the computer-supported coding game. Our findings can help us further consider how families can support children as they learn CT skills in out-of-school environments.

AB  - This Research to practice work in progress paper explores teachers' experiences about a professional development program focused on discipline-based computational thinking (CT). The goal of the program is to integrate computational practices into disciplinary learning environments at the K-12 level in Colombia. To promote this integration and to explore teachers' conceptions and possible scenarios to integrate CT in this context, the research team designed, implemented, and assessed a 20-hour professional development program with 21 teachers from public middle and high schools in Antioquia, Colombia. The program introduced the concepts and practices of CT and discussed why these are relevant for students to learn. A use-modify-create instructional sequence was used as the pedagogical approach to scaffold participants' learning process. At the end of the workshop, the teachers completed a survey regarding their experience in the program. Preliminary results indicate that the participating teachers increased their knowledge and interest to integrate computational thinking practices into their disciplinary learning environments.

AB  - Computational Thinking was an important way to study computer science and it explained the relationships between human, calculation and computer in terms of thinking. The computer science was raised from the theory of tools to the height of thinking. This paper introduced three levels of Computational Thinking: Computational Thinking in computer science, Computational Thinking in computing science and Computational Thinking in all subjects and analyzed the thinking characteristic of calculation and the calculation attribute of thinking. Through Computational Thinking, human can solve problems by using computer more efficiently. Therefore, the cultivation of Computational Thinking's ability was particularly important in teaching. But Computational Thinking cannot be taught without carrier and the programing course was the best way for they were closely related with each other. The paper took the Maze Problem as an example to express the differences between human and computer in the aspects of storage structure, thinking mode, solving procedure, etc. and it compared the human brain's multi-dimension and multi-forms characteristics with the computer's ne-dimension and one-form characteristics. The paper thought the goal of teaching was not to learn knowledge itself, but to form problem solving thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking, also called structural thinking is characterized by design and construction. In view of the existing problems of traditional teaching methods in high vocational colleges, we propose a teaching method aimed at developing the computational thinking of students. This article analyses the courses of high vocational colleges and the characteristics of students firstly. Then we design the teaching activities based upon the principles and strategies of computational thinking. Finally we offer a real teaching case. The teaching evaluations from students indicate that the teaching method based on computational thinking is very effective.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT)., considered to be one of the three major scientific thinking styles of human beings., is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However., as a cross-domain competency., appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed., the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on using scales or test to measure programming proficiency and neglecting process evaluation in which CT can also be manifested. Game-based learning assessments (GBLA) are able to assess tacit knowledge by avoiding jargon in test items., constructing irrelevant material., and reducing anxiety., avoiding the barriers of traditional assessments in assessing students' abilities. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT., it is necessary to integrate diverse problem-solving contexts using a digital game-based assessment model to measure CT. We invited 13 experts to participate in three rounds of the Delphi method and constructed a CT skills assessment model based on the digital game. The model had good consistency and was divided into four primary indicators., namely “Analysis”., “Design”., “Iteration”., and “Generalization”., which were weighted as 0.26., 0.11., 0.24., and 0.39., respectively and 14 secondary indicators. Taken together., the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating digital games in measuring CT skills in a comprehensive manner.

AB  - The development of computational thinking skills through computer programming is a major topic in education, as governments around the world are introducing these skills in the school curriculum. In consequence, educators and students are facing this discipline for the first time. Although there are many technologies that assist teachers and learners in the learning of this competence, there is a lack of tools that support them in the assessment tasks. This paper compares the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch, a free/libre/open source software assessment tool for Scratch, with McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead's metrics, two classic software engineering metrics that are globally recognized as a valid measurement for the complexity of a software system. The findings, which prove positive, significant, moderate to strong correlations between them, could be therefore considered as a validation of the complexity assessment process of Dr. Scratch.

AB  - The concept of computational thinking is timely. It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing.

AB  - With the development of science and technology, the talents of high-quality composite New Engineering Subjects need strong engineering practice ability, innovation ability, and international competitiveness. The college students have not only basic skills in computer operation but also certain programming skills. Those who understand and practice computational thinking will solve various non-universal computing problems encountered in work and study in the contemporary information society. In order to support the teaching objectives and educational concepts of the new engineering discipline, teaching reforms have been carried out in terms of teaching objectives, teaching content, teaching models, teaching resources, and ideological and political education. We cultivate interdisciplinary and professional integration through advanced thinking methods. It integrates knowledge points into practical engineering applications and cultivates students' computational thinking ability. It also improves the practical application and problem-solving abilities of students. In addition, we integrate ideological and political elements into the teaching process. It is a teaching method that combines moral education and professional courses.

AB  - As a fundamental and introductory course in undergraduate education, Computer Basis aims to cultivate the scientific computational thinking mode and the ability of solving problem for students who are not the computer majors. In this study, a new pedagogical method named PBL-VP combining the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and the visual programming Blockly was applied to Computer Basis. This paper described a classical example about problem solving to explain the teaching process of the PBL-VP in detail. The process of problem solving was divided into several operable steps to gradually guide students to analyze problems, provide solutions and establish scientific logic thinking. Blockly was introduced to obscure the grammar of programming language and implement the algorithm visually. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the PBL-VP teaching method on student learning by a contrast test. The empirical results proved that students in the class with PBL-VP earned higher final grades and the teaching method we proposed played a positive role in computer general education.

Combining the top two open-source data science tools, Python (within Jupyter notebooks) and R (within R studio software), we illustrate some of results from data preprocessing (cleaning, wrangling) for the diagnostic primary-school test of inquiry skills where Python tools (e.g. Pandas library) became more advantageous. As for the subsequent intensive statistical analysis, R environment was more suitable. We demonstrate summary results of the statistical analysis of the computer thinking diagnostic test for primary and secondary schools, finally cross-checked in SPSS software. Due to the current COVID-19 situation, we are still collecting data from ITA project impacts for which we finally show how we plan to implement further methods for data collecting, analysis and implementation in collaboration with our colleagues - education researchers.

AB  - This research article assesses the concepts of Computational Thinking (CT) as applied in basic education. Although widely used in K12 education, many articles indicate a lack of uniformity in the conceptualization of CT. CT is defined as the systematic problem-solving ability based on algorithmic processes. It is seen as crucial for stimulating interest and diversity in STEM careers. Effective CT teaching requires precise conceptualization and appropriate teaching techniques. With the world's increasing digitization, CT is considered as fundamental as reading or math skills and should be taught from K12 education. This article reports a systematic mapping of CT con-cepts applied in K12 activities, reflecting on the chosen activities and teaching techniques. Despite some articles highlighting the unclear definition of CT, there is a notable agreement on its key concepts. The study used the IEEEXplore database, analyzing primary articles from 2019–2023. The findings reveal a high degree of similarity in CT concepts, indicating a trend towards standardization. A catalog of frequently cited activities used to teach CT is presented, aiding teachers in introducing CT in their classes. This study supports the development of teaching policies and initiatives. contributing to STEM interest and diversity.

AB  - This Innovative Practice Full Paper details a design-based research approach for implementing computational learning activities in a first-year engineering physics course. This study contributes to the growing body of research on computation in engineering education by introducing computational concepts and activities during a physics laboratory class. Drawing from Experiential Learning Theory and using an adapted version of the Use-Modify-Create framework for teaching computational thinking, a series of lab activities was designed that combined physical lab experiments with computational modeling using custom-built VPython simulations. Data was collected from the labs in the form of (1) responses to lab activity worksheets, (2) code modified and/or generated by the students during lab activities, (3) in-code comments provided by the students during the activities. A qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze students' learning benefits and any challenges faced during the activities. While results show a number of learning benefits, an observed homogeneity of student responses to the questions on the lab handouts point to a set of potential limitations within the activities themselves that warranted further examination. Insight gained from this analysis process is presented as a set of four design principles that will inform future implementations of the hybrid course design.

AB  - This study aims to investigate students’ engagement in computational thinking skills through game-based learning in science classrooms. Data was gathered through observation and interviews with 30 secondary school students. Research data were analyzed qualitatively through six stages involving preparing and organizing data, exploring data, developing descriptions, representing results, interpreting findings, and validating the accuracy of findings. The study results show that game-based learning makes students engaged in computational thinking skills. Interaction with educational games trains students to find solutions more precisely and bravely in making decisions. Game-based learning can be a solution to introduce students’ computational thinking skills in a more enjoyable way. Teachers are expected to use this research to teach students computational thinking skills through game-based learning.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), problem-solving and programming skills are important for the students with major of computer education of higher levels education which related to the computing science contents. The instructions must provide the basic contents and learning activities, including Internet of Things (IoT), big-data and programming, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. However, these courses present learning difficulties based upon the students' individual skills. Development and integration of the IoT system would offer supporting tools for learning activities and improve the students' computational thinking, problem-solving, and programming skills. This paper presents the design and development of IoT system to support students' computational thinking, problem-solving, and programming skills training through block-based programming and integrated platforms. The IoT system comprises three layers (hardware, middleware, and applications), using existing platforms and devices as well as newly developed. To validate the viability of the proposed pipelined realization, the developed systems were implemented for higher education level students of computer education program. The students' computational-thinking, problem-solving, and programming skills were significantly improved through the proposed learning system throughout the course.

AB  - Technologies for development have great potential in accelerating the socio-economic progress of disadvantaged communities. But these technologies are usually developed by people removed from the daily realities of fieldwork. This paper explores the need and the possibilities of educating rural populations and social workers on the use of technology to create their own digital artifacts. We discuss two workshops, one for villagers in the state of Telangana and the second one for graduate students of a university social work department exploring the use of MIT's Scratch software as a tool for assisting in social interventions. We also discuss the results of an acceptability study among the social work students to gauge the potential for such a tool to be used in the field.

The approach is independent of programming languages and uses a generic abstract syntax tree and projects’ metadata to calculate metrics, and establish relationships between measures, school regions, educational centers, and student groups. The research relates source code analysis using abstract syntax trees to some of the main computational thinking concepts. Preliminary results obtained using the proposed method are presented and discussed.

AB  - The Asia-Pacific region has been dominating the global video game market for years. In recent years, an increasing number of Indonesia students are turning their interest to study in Taiwan. However, Chinese education in Indonesia is fundamentally based on studies of Mainland China, therefore lacking opportunities for students to understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture. Furthermore, there is a lack of opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan. The purpose of this on-going program (2014-recent) is to enhance the understanding of game and animation design education in Taiwan, through exchanges with students in Indonesia. It aims to promote exchanges between the faculty and students at the universities with faculties, lecturers and artists in Taiwan for collaborative work, especially in game art design, game engine and animation. It sincerely hopes that students could understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture by game and animation online tutorials, and provide opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan, Indonesia, and worldwide market. After a year of implementing the four points mentioned in this article, we have already observed some evident outcome. The biggest achievement comes from the workshop which has received significant responses and an increasing number of attendances from both Taiwan and Indonesia. In the near future, it hopes that we can hold a public event such as lecture, workshop and exhibition to raise awareness of and develop an affinity with Taiwanese langue and culture among the general public using the design thinking approach for computational creativity, such as co-design Taiwan language on-line course or game-based learning.

AB  - The present research aimed to assess if the teaching of the Yupana using the Tawa Pukllay method developed by Prem [16] enables to develop the computational thinking (CT) in children of 10 and 11 years old. For this purpose, a quasi-experiment with 52 children of two elementary schools located in Lima, Peru was performed. The obtained results were statistically significant showing that the experimental group, comprised with the students who were trained with the Yupana improved their CT compared to the control group, in which the students kept doing their regular activities. This highlights the fact that using this ancestral math tool could serve as an instrument to develop the CT in children.

AB  - Computational thinking has recently been widely recognized as a fundamental skill that should be cultivated for everyone and in every field. Although there is an increasing interest in research in teaching and learning computational thinking in recent years, an engaging, effective online learning system is yet to be built for teaching, learning, and applying computational thinking online. To this end, we have developed DATAVIEW, an online social learning system for learning computational thinking concepts and skills online. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus "i" is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well.

AB  - The era of big data witnesses that ‘computing’ has become an indispensable tool for medical development in many aspects of medicine domain. The ability of computational thinking is of great significance to medical students engaging in basic research and clinical diagnosis and treatment in the future. However, medical students are lack of this strategy in dealing with problems at present. Meanwhile, there is also a problem of ‘insufficient skills and no training’ in computer learning. In this article, we recommend training students’ computational thinking from three aspects. First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software. At last, under the help of MATLAB, some specific medical cases enable students to apply computational thinking to practice comprehensively. Our practice in class shows that these training methods has positive influence in improving students computational thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking has become a interesting subject and important concept in education throughout the nation. Computational Thinking (CT) has been defined as an important skill as digital literacy that must be learned by next generation. Along with the need to make an agreed definition of CT many countries are still in the process of, or have not started, introducing CT into the curriculum at all levels of education. It was also found in Indonesia that Computer Science / Computing, which could be the most obvious place to teach CT, has not been the main subject in several schools. This research aim is to design an alternative CT learning media to study interestingly and effectively computational concept which consists of 4 elements, namely decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm. Research and Development followed by ADDIE development model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) is used to capture the problem, identify the user need to be implemented in digital media. This learning media application product is equipped with an educational game based on computational thinking. The media has several features such as presentation of material and examples of problems and the solution, and small challenges in a games consisting of 3 stages. The subjects of this study were students of K-12. The data used for analysis was collected in several ways, including observation, questionnaire, pre-test and post-test in similar question. The result is the use of CT learning media is very helpful to improve students' understanding of CT in problem solving even in different topics.

AB  - Identifying engaging programming tasks to teach computational thinking and programming skills, especially to students of post-secondary education, is a challenging problem for lecturers. Physical computing is a potential solution that provides ample opportunities for creative development of such skills. The availability of pre-assembled physical computing tool kits often do not offer the right level of abstraction and flexibility to suit educator's needs. Consequently, this paper presents the design of a custom physical computing tool kit, T{h}inker, primarily for learning and teaching computational thinking and programming skills. Prior to design discussions, the context and motivation behind designing T{h}inker has been presented. Preliminary pilot deployment sessions of T{h}inker for both teachers and students confirm its potential as an effective tool for both teaching and learning of thinking skills.

AB  - Promoting the computational thinking of the K12 students through artificial intelligence education is reflected in curriculum standards and academic research. Game-based learning promotes the learning interest and motivation, helps students reinforce computational thinking practices. Based on the input-process-result (IPO) game-based learning model, this study integrated the artificial intelligence instructional content, game-based learning, and the core elements of computational thinking practice to design game-based learning activities that was suitable for promoting computational thinking practices in artificial intelligence courses. In this research, the artificial intelligence course “Challenging Tic-Tac-Toe” was conduct in senior high school. The results showed that the game-based learning in artificial intelligence courses could help students to master artificial intelligence subject knowledge, significantly improved the computational thinking practices, enhanced learning interest, motivation, self-confidence, and reduce cognitive load. Thus, this study provides additional evidence that using the game-based learning strategies is an effective learning method that improves both learning performance and computational thinking practices.

AB  - This work-in-progress paper will explore the effectiveness of topic modeling to support the analysis of Colombian teachers' conceptions of computational thinking (in Spanish) in an online professional development program. Computational thinking has become a form of literacy as it can help individuals to solve problems. Consequently, governments and bodies of accreditation worldwide have supported educational initiatives, primarily at the K-12 level. However, curricular changes are not enough. Teachers need to be prepared, so they develop the content knowledge associated with computational thinking concepts, practices, and applications in the classroom. To contribute to professional development opportunities geared toward the development of computational thinking pedagogical content knowledge, the Colombian National Academy of Exact, Physics, and Natural Sciences and the Global Center for Equitable Computer Science Education implemented an open online professional development program for Latin American early childhood and elementary educators. More than 100 teachers enrolled in a six-week online professional development program to integrate computational thinking activities from early childhood education. The program included two modules focused on conceptual understanding of computational thinking in early childhood and four more modules where the participants adapted, designed, implemented learning activities, and reflected on what happened during the implementation. As part of the participants' weekly interactions, the program included a Jamboard space, where the teachers answered a set of guiding questions, just like a discussion forum, but as a post-it wall, where they could access all their peers' contributions and questions in a single space.

AB  - Complex problem solving is one of the key skills for future jobs, but it has not been clearly operationalized. We hypothesized that it is a construct of inquiry, computational thinking, and mathematical problem solving. The hypothesis was empirically tested by administering tests to 261 high school students for assessing three inquiry skills, two dimensions of computational thinking and five mathematical problem solving skills. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a three factor model of inquiry skills and two factor model of computational thinking skills to have a good fit. Mathematical problem solving skills were characterized with a two factor model. These factors were combined in a higher-order factor model into one construct that could be defined as a complex problem solving skill.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill that is not only confined to computer scientists’ activities but can be widely applied in daily life and is required in order to adapt to the future and, therefore, should be taught at early ages. Within this framework, assessing CT is an indispensable part to consider in order to introduce CT in the school curricula. Nevertheless, efforts involving the formal assessment of computational thinking has primarily focused on middle school grades and above; and are mostly based on the analysis of projects in specific programming environments. A Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt), aimed at early ages, and based on the Computational Thinking Test [1], has been designed including several improvements; submitted to a content validation process through expert´s judgement procedure; and administered to Primary School students. The BCTt design is considered adequate by experts and results show a high reliability for the assessment of CT in Primary School, particularly in first educational stages.

AB  - Currently we see globalization and technological advances accelerating worldwide, transforming the world of work and human coexistence. We still notice that the educational systems, in their majority, are disconnected from these global realities. In this sense, it is necessary to have an educational formation more aligned to the contemporary world, preparing young people for the challenges of the 21st century, how to deal with technological resources and processes, developing soft and hard skills. In this way, it can be observed that in recent years computational thinking has gained relevance in this scenario, being a field of research in the most varied areas of knowledge, developing communication skills, creativity, leadership, problem solving, familiarity with technologies, management, transforming young people into autonomous individuals who are prepared for the technological changes that the world requires. Taking these transformations as a reference, this paper describes/presents the development of an online tool to stimulate computational thinking in elementary school, through online games. he use of the ThinkinGame makes it possible to identify the pillars to be worked on with young people, after its use, thus improving the approaches to be given in the formation of these young people, being able to turn attention to the challenge of teaching additional skills, such as sophisticated thinking and flexible problem solving.

AB  - Context In many countries, it is now important to integrate learning-oriented views to foster computational thinking (CT) in the classroom. This has inspired ideas for new lesson plans, instructional strategies, teacher guidance, and, most importantly, new approaches to grading these skills. Aim: This article presents the results of a systematic review initially focused on identifying the various ways of assessing CT in school and their relationship to relevant CT skills. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess CT in schools. This review applied a semi-automatic search for specific terms within the selected papers. These terms came from the analysis of several established definitions of CT. Results: We present a set of the most representative competencies and concepts developed in various experiences, in which the main topic is the assessment of CT, as well as some that have not been developed and that may be the subject of future works. Conclusions: The evaluation of CT in the school requires multiple approaches; it is a challenge to have a single method or strategy to evaluate everything that CT implies.

AB  - Computing in schools has gained momentum in the last two years resulting in GCSEs in Computing and teachers looking to up skill from Digital Literacy (ICT). For many students the subject of computer science concerns software code but writing code can be challenging, due to specific requirements on syntax and spelling with new ways of thinking required. Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education. Were computing taught as a more serious subject like science and mathematics, public understanding of the complexities of computer systems would increase, enabling those not directly involved with IT make better informed decisions and avoid incidents such as over budget and underperforming systems. We present our exploration into teaching a variety of computing skills, most significantly "computational thinking", to secondary-school age children through three very different engagements. First, we discuss Print craft, in which participants learn about computer-aided design and additive manufacturing by designing and building a miniature world from scratch using the popular open-world game Mine craft and 3D printers. Second, we look at how students can get a new perspective on familiar technology with a workshop using App Inventor, a graphical Android programming environment. Finally, we look at an ongoing after school robotics club where participants face a number of challenges of their own making as they design and create a variety of robots using a number of common tools such as Scratch and Arduino.

AB  - In this study, the authors develop an iOS software “n-Queens Problem for Education” and discuss its application in the promotion of computational thinking. As it has already been pointed out in [1] and [2], playing games and solving puzzles are effective in cultivating computational thinking, and our gaming software can be a good tool to cultivate skills regarding “Generalization (Pattern Recognition),” “Abstraction;' and “Algorithms” of computational thinking. Our software “n-Queens Problem for Education” is based on the well-known “The n-Queens Puzzle,” which involves solving a puzzle of placing eight chess queens on an n × n chessboard so that they do not attack one another. This puzzle is a good way for students to learn computational thinking. Since this software shows the queens' moves and evaluates solutions, you can concentrate on using your brain without writing down the moves or erasing wrong solutions. In addition, this software has features such as the symmetry operations of rotation and reflection of the board that help users study their solutions.

Lots of these initiatives, however, have been conceived to address the shortage of professionals in the technology sector, an approach that is encouraged by the software industry. On the contrary, this article argues that the focus should swift towards computational thinking, an ability that goes far beyond computer science or technology, fostering fundamental skills for the citizens of the twenty-first century. In this paper we summarize the findings of recent investigations that study computational thinking from different perspectives, explaining what this new skill is made of, presenting outcomes of school interventions showing relationships between the development of this ability and improvements in different subjects and soft skills, presenting technologies to foster its development, and reviewing tools that support educators in the assessment of this skill.

AB  - In this work we, study the self-efficacy of the use of the Choreographe software in block programming using the NAO robot in order to develop instructional videos in the classroom within the framework of Computational Thinking. The put forward objectives were three; (1) Evaluate the level of significance of self-efficacy and the applicability of CT concepts. (2) Measure the relationship between the applicability of CT concepts with the ease of use, usefulness, attitude and intention to work in the future with an instructional program. (3) Establish the percentages and means of the items of the variables concepts CT and self-efficacy. Thus, from a quantitative approach, we propose to create a questionnaire to measure self-efficacy and the level of knowledge acquired in block programming. 4 practical workshops of 2 hours each have been carried out with 28 initial training students between the ages of 23 and 27. The results yielded a positive correlation between the variables self-efficacy and computational thinking. Highlighting a positive acceptance of self-efficacy in the use of Choreographe software in the block programming experience and a growing ascendancy of interaction.

Even after software companies following Agile framework methodology to develop their software's, many software's still fail to meet the requirements and eventually customers end up not using them. This is usually because the software teams fail to completely understand the user requirements. Agile framework and Design Thinking framework can be used together to gain customer empathy and to overcome this problem. This study discusses how Agile framework and Design Thinking supports the same principles and can be used to reduce software development failures. A Flashcard application was developed to validate Agile framework Design Thinking framework. The results are discussed in the validation and result section.

AB  - In the 21st Century, technology has become a part of almost everyone's lives in the world and will keep on evolving. Therefore, people's way of thinking must be able to follow the technology evolution. Since 2006, Computational Thinking (CT) has been stated as a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. The concept of CT is very important to be taught to children so that it can be applied as early as possible. In the digital era that is happening now, the suitable CT learning for children is in the form of digital game as an application on smartphones. The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale.

AB  - In the age of Artificial Intelligence, the status of C++ Education Program in China's general high schools is somewhat embarrassing. On one hand, the programming training courses targeted K-12 students have been a big industry; on the other hand, the four editions of the current National High School Information Technology Curriculum textbooks are all in python. Based on the teaching experience of frontline teachers who have been teaching in general high schools for 18 years and the analysis of China's latest curriculum standards and core literacy requirements in information technology, this paper explores how general high schools can achieve sustainable C++ education program. At the curriculum level, combining the characteristics of C++ and students' developmental needs, two series of courses are formed: the General Studies Series and the Competition Series, the General Studies Series feature "wide range of content" and "real problem-driven"; the Competition Series featuring "deep" and "classic problems of computer science algorithms". At the teaching level, putting "problem understanding", "algorithm design", "algorithm experimentation and analysis" and "algorithm thinking communication" at the core of teaching practice, in stages and according to the types of students, differential teaching strategies are adopted, attaching importance to the problem context design and algorithm design, and emphasizing the process of "computational thinking" of the students. Only based on the all-round development of students' individuality, adjusting the curriculum and teaching, can the C++ Programming Education of ordinary high school be sustainable.

AB  - With the wide use of computers, how to make students understand the special way of thinking of computer science and find the appropriate methods to solve problems in their own fields like computer scientists are the challenges for educators. This paper proposed a computational thinking model based on blended learning Mctbbl and a descending dimension method for problem-space transformation. The Mctbbl model analyzes and researches the application of computational thinking in computer science by the organic combination of computational thinking and blended learning in a life-cycle perspective. On one hand, the model can summarize the core concepts and important principles in computer science and extract the typical thoughts and general methods of solving problems; on the other hand, the model can implement the teaching and learning of computational thinking by means of blended learning. Based on the model, the teachers can teach the problem-solving process by using computer more intuitively and clearly and the students can understand the application of computer knowledge more easily and simply. The Mctbbl prolongs the study life cycle which takes preview as beginning, teacher-student discussion as body and practical application as core to ensure integrity, endurance and consistency of teaching.

AB  - Job opportunities and the need for programmers are increasing. Companies are looking for new hires who have the ability to learn how to learn, who have computational thinking skills. Student dropout rate in computer science is the highest among college majors. Educators are striving to find a way to teach efficiently and effectively the technical and the problem solving skills students need. In this paper we will be studying the effects of syntax exercises on a subject's ability to think computationally and precisely. We tested our process on professionals and students. Half of the professionals were in the computer science field and half of our students did syntax exercises. The other half of professionals and students had no exposure to syntax to compare. Our purpose is to find if teaching students syntax exercises are still relevant and can teach both technical and computational thinking skills.

AB  - In this pilot study we created and evaluated a new version of the TechCheck Computational Thinking (CT) assessment designed specifically for kindergarten students. The original version of TechCheck was validated in first and second graders and consists of 15 multiple choice unplugged challenges drawn from six CT domains. The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument. Results of this pilot study indicate that TechCheck-K has acceptable characteristics for assessment of CT in kindergarten children.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of life-long conditions that are characterized by qualitative impairments in social interactions, problem solving and constructive skills. Children with learning disabilities such as autism face challenges in generating suitable and optimal solutions to problems. Those challenges can severely affect their interactions with others. Thus, teaching children with ASD problem solving and computational thinking skills could help them resolve conflicts that may happen in their everyday life. Effective problem solving is critical for their academic and social success and since one of the most effective tools for teaching children with autism is through using visual aids, the work in this paper reports the design and implementation of a serious game that aims at cultivating problem solving skills and teaching programming concepts to children with ASD. The presented game is suitable for children 7 to 14 years of age diagnosed with ASD to learn programming concepts. The preliminary prototype for the game gained positive responses from experts and 12 children with ASD from Caritas Egypt association and Hope Academy.

AB  - The development of computer science has led to an increase in programming education for younger people. Many countries have begun programming education in elementary schools. As is a relatively new subject in elementary education, the course design and textbooks for programming education remain under development. The growth trend in computational thinking (CT) is helpful for educators to teach suitable programming concepts to students. Scratch, which is mostly used as an introductory programming language for elementary school students, can be evaluated to reflect students’ CT. In this work-in-progress research, we conducted a data-driven analysis on fourth-grade students’ CT growth in their first 3 years of programming learning by evaluating their Scratch projects. A preliminary result shows that CT grows rapidly in the first 2 years and tends to be stable in the third year. The reasons for the difference in growth of specific CT concepts are discussed.

AB  - BlockPy is a block-based program language which has both block-based interface and traditional text-based interface. It fills the gap between block-based programming and language coding. But there is little work that focuses on the Computational Thinking(CT) evaluation of BlockPy programs. In this paper, we design and implement a BlockPy Analysis Tool to assess the CT skills of BlockPy programs automatically. We use Python's built-in AST module to analyse each node in the abstract syntax tree(AST) of each BlockPy program. Then, considering the characteristics of Python language, we propose a new CT Evaluation Criteria based on Scratch Analysis Tool(SAT). Under the guidance of the CT Evaluation Criteria, we propose a detailed scoring program to analyze each node of the program and get the CT score. Experimental results show the superiority of our tool compared with other analysis tools.

AB  - This feasibility study investigates the practicality of incorporating Computational Thinking (CT) education into secondary school curricula, aiming to equip students with essential 21st-century skills. The study assesses the readiness of educational institutions, teachers and students to embrace CT as an integral part of their learning journey, identifying potential challenges and barriers to successful implementation. To achieve these objectives, the research examines the existing landscape of CT education, evaluates teacher preparedness, analyses student receptiveness, and explores resource requirements and best practices from around the world. As part of this investigation, an immersive learning approach will be integrated. A five-day training program was implemented, featuring a comprehensive curriculum that covered key CT concepts, problem-solving techniques, presentation skills, and problem-based learning aligned with Sustainable Development Goals. The program included pre-and post-surveys to measure students’ understanding of CT concepts and practical projects to apply their learning. Results showed consistent improvement in students’ self-reported understanding of CT skills and their ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems. The study reveals that integrating CT into secondary education is not only necessary but also highly beneficial. The study emphasizes that a holistic educational reform incorporating leadership, technology and curriculum adjustments is essential for the successful implementation of CT education. The study also highlights the importance of aligning CT education with current educational policies and trends, such as KSSM (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah -Secondary School Standard Curricular), which advocate for the inclusion of CT as a fundamental practice of science education. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights and recommendations for educational policymakers, administrators, and educators interested in enhancing CT skills in secondary students.

The design thinking process is evolved based on the interaction among design intents, operations and justifications. The taxonomy of design intents is explored. Based on different pairs of design intents and operations, segments of the design thinking process are identified. A design thinking process knowledge management prototype system is developed for modeling design thinking process. An example of the original design of an automatic teller machine (ATM) demonstrates how the design thinking process model is represented.

AB  - Research studies provide some evidence that computing and education robotics have a positive impact on female students' engagement in Computational Thinking (CT) practices and their self-efficacy for CT. Other issues raised by research concern the decontextualization of computing education from the actual lives of students which causes problems for students under represented in the fields of computing and engineering, such as female students. To tackle this problem, paper aimed to develop (STEM-Computational Thinking (CT)-Computing) scenarios related to students' actual lives and their local communities in order to help female students to develop STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) competences, when core disciplinary ideas and cross-cutting concepts are infused in the scenarios. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry teaching and learning and the engineering design thinking instruction strategy using physical computing activities. A validated questionnaire for self-efficacy and CT practices was applied before and after the intervention to female prospective engineering school teachers studying at Higher Education Institutes in Greece. Results show a strong evidence for the effectiveness (enhancement of CT efficacy of female students) by using the STEM content epistemology through activities implemented with physical computing platforms.

AB  - Thinking skills training can effectively improve students' creative thinking and learning ability, and it is simple, practical and feasible. Now there are lots of educators and teachers who have done some researches in this area. But many controversial problems still exist, for example, whether thinking is needed to be taught, how to be taught, etc. This paper first discusses the necessity and connotation of thinking skills training, and discusses the trainability of thinking skills, then designs a course framework based on Edward de Bono's thinking training system and Tony Buzan's mind map, and chooses teaching thinking directly as an effective way to teach thinking skills. At last, we introduce the practice of the course framework in Beijing Normal University. Constructing a practical course framework of training thinking and putting it into practice are the innovations of this paper.

AB  - ChatGPT has received considerable attention in education, particularly in programming education because of its capabilities in automated code generation and program repairing and scoring. However, few empirical studies have investigated the use of ChatGPT to customize a learning system for scaffolding students’ computational thinking. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent programming scaffolding system using ChatGPT following the theoretical framework of computational thinking and scaffolding. A mixed-method study was conducted to investigate the affordance of the scaffolding system using ChatGPT, and the findings show that most students had positive attitudes about the proposed system, and it was effective in improving their computational thinking generally but not their problem-solving skills. Therefore, more scaffolding strategies are discussed with the aim of improving student computational thinking, especially regarding problem-solving skills. The findings of this study are expected to guide future designs of generative artificial intelligence tools embedded in intelligent learning systems to foster students’ computational thinking and programming learning.

AB  - The paper presents the details of a four-year project to test the effectiveness of teaching spreadsheeting with spreadsheet programming, instead of the traditional, widely accepted surface approach methods. The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences.

First of all, through the study of cognitive thinking and visual thinking, this article concludes that the two have important guiding roles in product design. Secondly, use the specific laws in cognitive thinking and visual thinking to derive the corresponding intelligent product design principles. Then, a intelligent product design process that is conducive to function setting and styling design is derived. The purpose is to introduce a good design plan for the material level, the behavior level, and the spiritual level. Finally, the research results are demonstrated by design practice. It is hoped that this article will have a certain enlightenment for related designers to carry out intelligent product design.

AB  - Most efforts to incorporate computational thinking in K-12 education use visual tools (e.g., Scratch) and focus on students in their first grades. Fewer projects investigate the development of computational thinking in students in the last years of school, who usually have not had early formal preparation to acquire these skills. This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of teaching C++ (a low-level programming language) to develop computational thinking in high school students in Chile. By applying a test before and after a voluntary C++ workshop, the results reveal a significant improvement in computational thinking after the workshop. However, we observe that there was a tendency to drop out of the workshop among students with lower levels of initial computational thinking. Besides, tenth-grade students obtained lower final scores than eleventh and twelfth-grade students. These results indicate that teaching a low-level programming language is useful, but it has high entry-barriers.

AB  - Education development continues to proliferate in Indonesia, so many learning methods are applied, but the number of students with HOTS abilities in Indonesia is minimal. The issues affecting HOTS in Indonesia are (1) Not yet able to adapt, (2) Lack of basic knowledge early on, and (3) Few apply HOTS. The research goals were to examine XYZ generations' HOTS variables in the e-learning concept. This research used Structural Equation Model (SEM) and SmartPLS as statistical tools. With the Judgement sampling method, data were collected through an online questionnaire from 184 respondents from April 21–28, 2022, consisting of students and lecturers at 20 universities in Indonesia who also came from various regions in Indonesia. The proposed model has six variables: Learning Environment, Learning Motivation, Peer Interaction, Learning Strategy, Learning Style, HOTS in e-learning concept, and eight hypotheses. All hypotheses have a significant influence.

AB  - Visual programming languages can be used to make computer science more accessible to a broad range of students. The evaluative focus of current research in the area of visual languages for educational purposes primarily aims to better understand motivational benefits as compared to traditional programming languages. Often these visual languages claim to teach students computational thinking concepts; however, although the evaluations show that students may exhibit more enthusiasm, it is not always clear what computational thinking concepts students have actually learned. In this paper we attempt to develop a visual semantic evaluation tool for student-created games and simulations that goes towards depicting the computational thinking concepts implemented by the students. Through semantically analyzing a given student's created projects over time, this visual evaluation tool, called the Computational Thinking Pattern (CTP) graph, can possibly indicate the existence of computational thinking transfer from games to science simulations.

AB  - Many technology and design-based disciplines are facing increasing demands to prepare students to perform effectively within computational and simulation environments. Further, students' spatial abilities are an important prerequisite to technological literacy within virtual environments. In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities teaching a large group of first-year, interdisciplinary students to apply spatial thinking skills by undertaking a team-based, design project using an industrial-strength computational design environment (SolidWorks). We describe key instructional principles and techniques used to minimize the complexity of this computational tool, thus enabling students to focus on the tasks and reasoning requirements of the design project. While encouraged by the high degree of students' motivation for building functioning animated mechanical toys (AMTs), students frequently reported being “lost” in SolidWorks (SW) during the modeling phases of the project. Our techniques for scaffolding learning activities have continued to evolve to minimize the challenges faced by novice users of SW and to better support them in developing their spatial thinking skills. We also present our experiences, lessons learned, and ideas for improving the design of the project, and learning activities, such as worked examples of an AMT model, to further reduce the cognitive load and to enable students to focus on visual-spatial reasoning rather than on the tacit skills associated with using SolidWorks.

AB  - This full paper presents the instillation of computational thinking (CT) in undergraduate students across multiple disciplines through an adaptive gamified e-learning platform. In today’s fast-paced digital age, possessing CT abilities is essential for effective critical thinking and problem-solving across various fields. To cultivate CT proficiency in students from diverse disciplines, we designed an innovative adaptive gamified e-learning platform called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ). The eight key features of CTQ are (1) interactive storyline with customizable avatars, mini-games, and questions; (2) performance profiler; (3) comprehensive question bank with questions at three difficulty levels; (4) feedback and answer to each question; (5) additional learning resources via hyperlinks; (6) badges and leaderboard; (7) progress saving feature; and (8) integrated online feedback survey. The CTQ was introduced to recently enrolled first-year undergraduate students across all five discipline clusters at Singapore Institute of Technology. The learning performance and feedback of 135 students were gathered and examined. The student population comprised 33 Business, Communication and Design (BCD); 48 Health and Social Science (HSS); and 54 Infocomm Technology (ICT) undergraduates. Statistical results from the paired Student’s t-test reveal significant differences (p < 0.05) (i) between the pre-test and post-test scores for HSS, ICT, and all students combined; (ii) between the pre-test duration and post-test duration for all three clusters and all students combined; (iii) between the self-assessed knowledge score before CTQ and after completing CTQ for all three clusters and all students combined. Moreover, majority of the students commented that the CTQ generates interest in CT, is an engaging learning platform with enriching educational content, and has motivated their independent learning. Lastly, CTQ functions as an online preparatory course aimed at reducing the diversity in academic backgrounds and varying levels of prior knowledge of computer programming languages among students. This will help smoothly transition students into programming-relevant modules, and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

AB  - In the present Research-to-practice Full-paper, the learning, reasoning, and problem-solving processes, in engineering students, have been analyzed from different approaches, one of them is the computational thinking process, where most of the activities must be performed as a computer does and the reasoning is developed with the well-oriented activities realized by them. In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain. Finally, the results showed that the computational thinking process can be developed by students, as they must program equations, analyze data, understand it, and identify graphically the variables involved, linking the learning of a physical concept with a computational tool that let them understand in a more clear, specific, and ordered thinking.

AB  - This study originates from the content synthesis of studies on computational thinking, need assessment, gamification, and computational thinking with coding from Thai and international scholarly articles published in accredited databases. Then, the synthesis results were integrated into the development of computational thinking through gamification and programming knowledge to improve the efficacy of computational learning. The process commenced with an analysis of the learners' needs obtained through the questionnaires concerning computational thinking. Data analysis illuminated the learners' levels of computational thinking as well as a fundamental understanding of what the learners need to be taught or what areas of skills each learner. With regards to this, conventional teaching approaches may not serve best to transmit the relevant knowledge which may subsequently induce unfavorable attitudes toward computational thinking. With the data elicited through the need assessment, instructors will have a clear direction as to how the pedagogical process should be designed to directly address the needs in each of the computational thinking components. In general, each component of them is rather complex, so the researcher incorporated gamification theory-based learning defined by its enjoyable game mechanisms and challenging nature which makes the coding lesson fun with block programming enabling learners to proficiently grasp the concept of computational thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking is considered an important skillset for 21st century learners and became a subject of focus in K-12 education in the recent years. It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. There have been various approaches to teach computational thinking in early education stages that utilize modern technologies, such as physical computing and robotics, and adopt a playful manner. Mobile Augmented Reality is a promising technology along this path that lets users collaborate and interact with both physical and digital elements. However, the technology is still relatively new and has not been studied extensively with students, especially in formal educational settings. In this paper we present ARQuest, a collaborative mobile augmented reality game for developing computational thinking skills of primary school students. The game combines a physical board and tangible tokens with animated 3D content, and students use them to create and solve challenges in a gamified environment. We have performed an exploratory study in two primary schools in order to explore the impact of ARQuest on students' understanding of algorithmic concepts, engagement and collaboration. The study led to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the game, as well as more generic aspects of interacting and collaborating in mobile augmented reality.

AB  - With the worldwide momentum of promoting computational thinking (CT) education, greater attention has been received on assessing learning effects in both cognitive and attitudinal aspects. However, the cross-lagged relations between the two were unknown. This study investigated the cross-lagged association between CT cognitive performance and attitudinal beliefs of primary students through a three-wave longitudinal design. The paper reported the first two waves of data collection, with an 8-month time interval, involving a sample of 392 students (age 9-11). At each wave, students were asked to complete a CT cognitive test and a self-reported attitude survey. Through cross-lagged analyses, the results showed that prior CT cognitive performance significantly predicted later learning attitudes, and the paths remained significant after controlling for students’ demographics and learning experiences. The study contributes to the literature by pioneering documenting the cross-lagged relations between students’ cognitive and attitudinal attainments in the context of CT education.

AB  - We developed and piloted a new course titled Computer Science Teaching Methods (CSM) in the fall semester of 2019. This course was based on materials developed from a previous program that trained high school teachers in computational thinking and programming through LSU's Cain Center. Pedagogical content knowledge informed the design of this course. Also, data gathered from teacher and instructor interaction at multiple sites during the summer STEM professional development program contributed to the courses' design. The CS Methods course targeted undergraduate computer science majors who were considering a career in teaching or who were interested in CS pedagogy. We encountered several challenges recruiting and retaining students and found that computer science students attracted to teaching careers do not fall into the stereotype of most computer science majors. Participation of women was higher than the average undergraduate CS courses. A disconnect appeared between the pedagogical practices promoted for teaching computing at the high school level and those being practiced at the college level. After learning about the 5E pedagogical model for teaching computing, students expressed interest in the potential of using more student-centered instruction, not only for high school instruction, but also for their own college courses. An area of disconnect also emerged in the programming formats, as all the students were comfortable with Java but all were unfamiliar with popular block-based programming platforms, such as Scratch. The transition from the CS curriculum taught in high schools to what follows in college needs to be smoother.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence technology has made remarkable progress in machine learning, but it is still in its infancy in creative thinking or computational creativity. In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles. We plan to further use this model to address complex real-world problems, such as the study of cancer therapeutic targets

AB  - Recently, higher education has seen an increasing emphasis on the prominent role of computational thinking in all disciplines. Computational thinking is advocated as not only a fundamental skill or concept in computer science but also a core competency for all disciplines. Teaching students in non-computer science majors computing thinking is challenging because students do not have experts' mental models. This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms. Addressing these problems early and explicitly in future classes could improve the education of computational thinking and alleviate difficulties students may experience in using computational thinking in learning and problem solving.

AB  - As Virtual reality (VR) devices become more widespread, they are being recognized as efficient teaching tools for many subjects. In the 21st century, learners are expected to master important skills, which are difficult to teach in conventional lectures, such as computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and abstract reasoning. [1] Therefore, computer science or information technology courses often limit the discussion of recursion to calculating a factorial or a Fibonacci number, even though recursion is presented as an academic-type oddity in most cases. [2] To elucidate how VR can improve students’ computational thinking skills and abstract thinking associated with solving problems that require recursive algorithms, this paper examines the use of VR in computer science education to teach the abstract concept of recursion. The results of learners using VR Tower of Hanoi software are compared to those using the conventional Hanoi puzzle. Most learners show an improved understanding after experiencing the gameplay in the VR software, and some demonstrate a better understanding of recursion. In the post-survey, most participants acknowledge that the immersive environment is helpful when learning abstract subjects.

AB  - Game-based learning using interactive environments to impart theoretical and applied knowledge for introductory programming courses is divided in two popular approaches: “game making” and “game playing”. Various studies have been conducted following greatly the former approach in secondary and tertiary education with controversial results. However, there has been relatively little research shown about how game playing can be associated with the development of computational thinking and how fundamental programming concepts can be supported by playing games. This work investigates how a simulation game should be designed to support the development of computational problem-solving strategies through the medium of learning fundamental computer science concepts, by proposing a theoretical game playing framework.

AB  - This study aims to explore how users’ immersion in games affects their computational thinking and problem-solving abilities and to obtain basic knowledge for applying games to health promotion and treatment. “The Japanese version of the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ-J)” was prepared to grasp the immersion of games, and “the Japanese version of the Computational Thinking (CT) Scale” was prepared to measure CT. Correlation analysis was conducted to examine their relationships. We analyzed their relationships using correlation analysis and generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM). The results of the correlation analysis showed both weak positive correlations and weak negative correlations between the immersion factor and CT skills, indicating the importance of striking an appropriate balance between increasing player immersion and improving CT skills during game design. The results of generalized structural equation modeling revealed that while increased presence promoted creativity, high immersion hurt algorithmic thinking, flow state hurt problem-solving skills, and the factor of game immersion had no significant effect on cooperative skills. These findings suggest the importance of considering game design elements that target specific cognitive abilities in designing game-based health promotion and treatment programs. For example, immersive game design may effectively enhance creativity and problem-solving skills. This study is expected to contribute to the development of new approaches in the field of game-based health promotion and treatment.

AB  - The employment of technology as a tool is a reality in any area of knowledge. Technology is present and permanently impacts our society, including its effects on education. Computational thinking is a way of critically and creatively using the fundamentals of computer science to solve problems, making it essential for success in the job market. This article aims to stimulate computational thinking in children from the first years of elementary school, ranging from the 1 st to the 5 th grades, which corresponds to the age group from 6 to 10 years old. For developing computational thinking in the students, a didactic sequence was created using several tools, namely: naval battle, Blockly Games and the Scratch block programming language. The sequence of artifacts created with Scratch simulates a robot with color sensors, and, as students progress in learning, new challenges are added with the use of sensors, sounds and animations. This project aims to show the importance of computational thinking and encourage teachers to make it increasingly present in the classroom.

AB  - We introduce the idea of a symbolic description of a complex human learning task, in order to contribute to better understand how we learn. The learner is modeled on the basis of knowledge from learning sciences with the contribution of cognitive neurosciences, including machine learning formalism, in the very precise framework of a task, named #CreaCube reviewed here, related to initiation to computational thinking presented as an open-ended problem, which involves solving a problem and appealing to creativity. We target problem-solving tasks using tangible interfaces for computational thinking initiation, and describe in details how we model the task and the learner behavior in this task, including goal-driven versus stimulus-driven behavior and the learner knowledge construction. We show how formalizing these elements using an ontology offers a well-defined computational model and the possibility of inferences about model elements, analyzing and predicting the learner behavior. This operationalization of a creative problem-solving task is still at a preliminary stage, but an effective proof of concept is described in this study.

Computational literacy is an important ability to understand and communicate information in current digital age and ubiquitous age. The digital has been used as a tool of communication along with language. Therefore, we would need to have ability to express our idea and understand an other's presentation with language and digital, which is just computational Literacy. However, most educators focus on using computer and internet, not computational literacy. Therefore, we define the operational definition about computational literacy suited for the present age by analyzing existing computational Literacy. In addition, we extract educational factors from the relation with computational thinking that is the purpose of computational literacy. Finally, we discuss teaching-learning strategy of computational literacy for all level s of students.

AB  - Because design is an iterative and evolving process, recording and representing designer's thinking process plays an important role for design change and reuse. After giving a brief review of the previous related research, a design thinking process model is created for representing the design thinking process. Its knowledge structure consisting of design intent, design decision, design rationale and design operation is explained in detail. Based on the proposed model, a knowledge modeling language (Design Mental Modeling Language, DMML) is developed for expressing and reasoning the design thinking process explicitly. Semi-formal structure is used by DMML, which can improve both the expressiveness and computability of this language. A visual modeling system is developed for implementing DMML and an example is presented for illustration.

AB  - For a number of years, various games have been used as an educational tool at different academic levels, especially in primary education. However, only recently games that teach coding and algorithmic thinking or even broader, computational thinking, emerged. Initiatives like Hour of Code and similar online activities or block-based programming games popularized the field, while at the same time, projects like CSUnplugged showed that the “idea of programming” can be learned even without using the computer. In this paper, we present our experience so far in creating and implementing different unplugged activities that teach students of different age levels, from early primary school to the university students, the simple programming concepts and algorithms. As a part of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (STEM-C) outreach program named SUZA - From school to science and the academic community at University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Croatia, we conducted a number of game-like activities based on graph paper programming, block-based programming and using the existing board games. Although this is a work in progress project, the participant reactions so far, collected through interviews and questionnaires, indicated that the conducted activities were well accepted by students and their teachers. We also received a number of useful feedback comments and proposals, such as to expand the activities to include the homework part, or to make them more physical and relocate them outdoors.

AB  - Recent progress in AI has expanded the boundaries of the cognitive functions that can be simulated, but creativity remains a challenge. Neuroscience sheds light on its mechanisms and its tight relationship with episodic memory and cognitive control, while machine learning provides preliminary models of these mechanisms. We present these lines of research and explain how they can be exploited in the domain of computational creativity in order to further expand the capabilities of AI.

AB  - Problem-solving skills can make students more autonomous in their learning in addition to contributing to the individual's success in real-life situations (professionally or personally). In this sense, Computational Thinking, as a problem-solving approach that can involve information technologies, can contribute a lot to this subject. Therefore, due to its essence, the development of Computer Science concepts is closely related to the employment of problem-solving activities. However, teachers may face difficulties when proposing Computational Thinking problem-solving activities to their students. This paper proposes the engineering of a software that aims to allow teachers to generate challenges related to game and interactive animations programming to support their classes. The problems generated by the system, do not limit the learners' creative power. Besides that, teachers can balance the reasoning component of the challenges according to the learners' level of knowledge in programming and algorithms. An experiment with Computational Thinking workshops was analyzed in order to design the proposed software.

AB  - This full research-track paper demonstrates growth in computational thinking in a cohort of engineering students completing their first course in engineering at a large Southwestern university in the United States. Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans. The long-term impact is the creation of a measurement of student learning of computational thinking in engineering for courses and programs that wish to develop this important skill in their students.

AB  - Training computer scientists to address wicked problems means to focus respectively on the individual capability to think in a computational-oriented way (i.e., Computational Thinking), and on the social dimension of coding (i.e., Agile Values). In this study we propose the conceptual model of Cooperative Thinking, a new education construct of team-based computational problem solving. Cooperative Thinking is not only the sum of Computational Thinking and Agile Values, rather it is a new overarching competence suitable to deal with complex software engineering problems. We suggest to tackle the Cooperative Thinking construct as an education goal, to train new generations of software developers to Pareto-optimize both their individual and teaming performances.

AB  - While computational thinking arises as an essential skill worldwide, formal primary and secondary education in Latin America rarely incorporates mechanisms to develop it in their curricula. The extent to which students in the region acquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start addressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross sectional study that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming students at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines. Based on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant inequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private or no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into how these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a highly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies focused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary initiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten upcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable field for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar circumstances.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is considered a necessary 21st-century competence that should be introduced to school education as a vital ingredient. However, the lack of a consensual definition of CT and the confusion with other similar terms made it a big challenge for researchers and practitioners to understand this concept. The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science. These results provide sufficient granularity to allow us to come up with suggestions on how to choose appropriate and pragmatic CT definitions.

AB  - This Research to Practice Work-in-Progress paper discusses a next-generation learning system for K-12 students to educate them on scientific concepts surrounding the human body. Specifically, our gamified learning system is designed to make learning more fun, engaging, and effective through game and experiment elements that align with science and math learning standards. It will also increase systematic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning for K-12 students. Since the human body can be thought of as a combination of interacting systems, the game also introduces students to computational thinking by introducing internal body functions. To achieve these goals, this project has two components. First, an educational virtual reality game will be built according to the natural human body structure. During the game process, students will experience the same as the human body functions, travel along the blood circulation, help with the heartbeat, and participate in oxygen exchange. While students are playing the game, our gamified adaptive learning system tracks and controls the student's learning progress. As the AI component collects student data and uses this information, our system adjusts game content and addresses possible learner issues to refine the learning curriculum for a faster and more effective learning experience. Second, a series of hands-on activities will be conducted based on the functions of the human body (e.g., developing an artificial heart and experiencing how the heart works). Through this project, an attractive and efficient next-generation learning system will be developed and used to expose K-12 students to this learning system. The education of students will be accomplished in different dimensions through games and hands-on practice, respectively. Additionally, compared to traditional learning methods, our learning system not only increases students' interest in learning but also makes it more personalized compared to the conventional learning process. Likewise, we will refer to the results of self-efficacy surveys administered to students and teachers separately to test their perceptions of their abilities and the new system.

AB  - Studies with augmented reality show that while the technology helps the student learn, it may end up disturbing other points, showing that more research is needed with the use of augmented reality. Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology. This paper's main contribution is showing one possibility of using AR with Computational Thinking and what needs to evolve for it to be used by the usable by the children.

AB  - Physiological computing (PC) technology is becoming increasingly popular as wearable hardware improves. However, little is known regarding potential connections between hands-on experience with physiological computing technology and computation thinking perspectives. This is particularly true for black communities. Applications for physiological computing include systems such as wearable technology (e.g., Apple Watch) capable of mapping students' physiological activity to various outputs. The work discussed in this paper presents our initial steps toward filling these gaps. In particular, we share our observations of computational thinking perspectives that emerged while black high school students constructed simple programs driven by near real-time brain wave information. Our findings suggest interactive physiological data may lead to unique computational perspectives during learning activities.

AB  - CAM mechanism is widely used in engineering, it can realize the arbitrary and complex motion curve of the follower [1]. The typical design method of CAM pitch curve is based on the principle of inversion [2], [3]. In the process of designing CAM, the author uses creative thinking [4] to raise the question whether the design steps based on the inversion principle can be applied "in reverse". Based on this problem, the author takes the plate CAM mechanism with translating knife-edge follower as an example and verifies the design results of CAM pitch curve through two different motion curves. The results show that the inverse application on the principle of the inversion method does not change the CAM pitch curve.

AB  - Programming skills are very important nowadays, especially for students who are majoring in computer science. In order to have good knowledge, students should be able to learn independently. This study proposes Codify, a programming learning tool or e-learning platform for students where they are able to independently use several types of questions, including multiple choices, drop-down, drag-anddrop, and blank code. If students are not able to answer correctly, the system will recommend similar cases. For this study, the researchers applied the design thinking method to create a prototype of Codify to ensure that students who use it have a good user experience. Out of six scales in the user experience questionnaire (UEQ), five scales (Attractiveness, Efficiency, Dependability, Stimulation, and Novelty) are included in the Excellent category, while one scale (Perspicuity) is included in the Good category, meaning the Codify prototype has an excellent user experience with a slight improvement.

AB  - This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a K-12 teacher training workshop for computational thinking instruction. Computational thinking refers to a set of skills that are necessary for success in engineering and science careers. Teaching computational thinking skills prior to university-level enrollment helps students be more successful in their degree programs. Our project serves as an attempt to innovate science education by designing and testing data-driven, scientific inquiry experiences that integrate teaching and learning of atmospheric science with computational thinking and practices in authentic, innovative, and effective ways. In this paper, we describe our design process for developing authentic computational thinking and spatial visualization modules for the two-week computational thinking professional development that uses 3D weather visualizations to train K-12 teachers in eleven computational thinking and spatial visualization skills.

AB  - On the basis of analysis to existing literatures by which the thinking problems are studied using mathematic method and according to nerve foundation of thinking of human brain, several concepts such as thinking map and thinking route are proposed in this paper by imitating neuron (a kind of chemical substance) transition procedures (routes) during thinking of human brain as maps in discrete mathematics. Number of thinking routes is calculated by means of digraph adjacency matrix theory in graph theory. After comparison, the results basically satisfy the thinking routes in reality.

AB  - Algorithms and programming is a basic course in the department of computer science that teaches about the logic of thinking and basic programming techniques. However, it is known that students are difficult to understand it. Therefore, this study focuses on developing an application, called computational story, to teach the subject of algorithm and programming with the problem-posing approach and story problems. To achieve this goal, a model that considers the following aspects: basic structure in programming in C language, case studies, and choice of answer categories, is built. Then, an experimental research was conducted in a school to be seen to improve the students' understanding of algorithm and programming. The results obtained indicate that there is an increase in students' understanding, and this application can be used also to assess the critical thinking level of students in the future work.

AB  - The need for critically reflecting on the deceptive nature of advanced technologies, such as social robots, is urging academia and civil society to rethink education and the skills needed by future generations. The promotion of critical thinking, however, remains largely unaddressed within the field of educational robotics. To address this gap and question if and how robots can be used to promote critical thinking in young children's education, we conducted an explorative design study named Bringing Shybo Home. Through this study, in which a robot was used as a springboard for debate with twenty 8- to 9-year-old children at school, we exemplify how the deceptive nature of robots, if embraced and magnified in order for it to become explicitly controversial, can be used to nurture children's critical mindset.

AB  - Understanding preservice teachers' thinking styles and dispositions and how these are related to positive changes in their teacher behaviors provide valuable information for teacher preparation. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between preservice teachers' critical-thinking dispositions and three thinking styles (judicial, legislative, and executive) and their behavior change in a computer simulation. 178 preservice teachers participated in this study. Their interactive teaching experiences were measured via the CS-TGCTS simulation. The findings in this study suggest that preservice teachers with a high level of critical-thinking dispositions and those with judicial or legislative thinking styles are analytical and reflective vis A-vis their teaching practice and, as a consequence, they experienced great behavior change, whereas those with executive styles did not exhibit significant behavior change at the end of the simulated teaching.

AB  - This work-in-progress paper introduces an innovative approach that uses computational notebooks to teach Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate course to aid the understanding of complex phenomena in Mechanics of Materials, and enhance students' computational thinking skills. Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning. Students have access to the complete source code, allowing them to develop computational skills. Early exposure to coding, modeling, and simulation techniques is crucial in preparing students for the computational demands of modern engineering workplaces.

AB  - DISSECT (DIScover SciEnce through Computational Thinking) is a project aimed at introducing students to computer science principles by establishing computational thinking (CT) as a problem-solving technique within middle school and high school Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. While DISSECT has shown successful integration of CT into middle school and high school STEM curricula, illustrating the pervasive nature of CT, a question remained; “can CT also be infused into humanities courses (e.g., English, Art, History) in addition to scientific courses (e.g., Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science)?” The answer is positive. The objective of this paper is to present one approach to bridge the gap between CT and humanities through the curriculum of a 12th-grade English Literature course. The course blends CT practices with composition and literature to provide students with the ability to write critical and comparative analyses of selected literature. This paper will describe multiple modules that integrate computational thinking into the course, and discuss the results and assessment tools used to measure student competency in computational thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking has been widely regarded as an important ability to adapt to the future. College students use the knowledge they have learned to help elementary students in the community learn computational thinking, thereby enhancing the motivation and achievement of the course. Use Scratch software tools to support the learning of computational thinking. In addition to cultivating students’ basic knowledge and abilities, it also assists the lack of learning resources in community elementary schools through practical actions of service learning, so that students can focus their learning on task-base purposes. Comprehensive research and analysis are conducted based on the evaluation of the students' completed works, the learning satisfaction scale, and the data of the key indicators of self-evaluation of computational thinking, plus the questionnaire survey of the primary school students receiving assistance. The results show that: it helps to stimulate students' desire to learn, thereby significantly improving academic performance and learning motivation. At the same time, it makes students have self-confidence and a sense of accomplishment, and makes learners aware of the inadequacy of self-learning, and promotes their willingness to learn from passive to active.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) can be considered a 21st century core skill and, accordingly, it should be taught to students at an early age. Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year, teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode. The combination of different assessment methodologies&#x2014;including CT pre- and posttests, data-driven analytics, direct observation, and questionnaires&#x2014;provides assessment for each of the framework computational dimensions.

AB  - At the core of every computing related discipline and impacting everyone everywhere, computational thinking or CT has increasingly emerged as its own subject in all levels of education. How to effectively teach CT skills poses real challenges and creates opportunities. Focusing on engineering and computer science undergraduates, we resourcefully integrated elements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into introductory computing courses. In addition to a comprehension of the essence of CT, AI enabled inspirations of collaborative problem solving beyond abstraction, logical reasoning, critical, and analytical thinking. It fostered the study of basic data structures and algorithms. Students enjoyed active learning classrooms. Learning to learn, they constructed essential knowledge from solving exciting AI puzzles, competing in strategic AI games, and participating in intellectual discussion. Every activity is designed to allow students to fully engage their mental tools. Neither coding nor programming was required.

AB  - Computer Science (CS) is a profession that positively impacts every single area of society without which today's world would come to a complete halt. Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses.

AB  - The solution of a typical programming task involves algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, decomposition, and abstraction skills. These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don’t consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies. It was found that such feedback was very effective and improved the CT skill deficiencies of 82% of students.

AB  - In Japan, programming education in elementary schools has begun in 2020, and it is necessary to foster programming thinking effectively. Various learning tools have been developed to introduce programming concepts, and many studies have been conducted to develop tools using music to foster computational thinking that includes programming thinking. In this study, we focused on the affinity between the basic movements of the railway toy and the melodies and chord progressions, and we developed a learning tool to foster computational thinking by combining music and the railway toy. In this study, an activity using this tool was developed and subjects were asked to experience the activity. Based on the subjects' progress in the activity and their opinions in the questionnaire, the improvement of the activity is discussed.

AB  - This paper describes a collaborative project that was conducted to promote Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) Education among pre-service and in-service teachers as well as Teacher Preparation Faculty. More than 40 pre-service and in-service teachers and 9 Education faculty members from three schools participated in a learning experience designed to address the K-12 Computer Science Framework [1] and Maryland's K-12 Computer Science Standards. The collaboration was designed to develop CS/CT knowledge, understanding, skills and application among participants. In phase one of the project, pre-service and in-service teachers explored CS educational hard/software platforms and used open-source sites such as Sphero Edu, Wonder Workshop, Scratch and Code.org. They envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms, and they worked collaboratively to design a problem-based project for their own students. In phase two of the project, teacher preparation faculty were trained to integrate CS and CT into several preservice courses as well as build into the coursework sequence meaningful experiences that would expose future teachers to CS and CT knowledge and skills so that they could then incorporate these into their own K-8 lesson plans. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge. The feedback from the participants shows positive results.

AB  - In this paper we describe how to use a Game-Based Learning (GBL) approach to help end-user programmers to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills. CT represents a framework consisting of a set of skills such as: abstraction, decomposition and more in general problem solving expressed in a computational form (algorithmic thinking) that can be easily formalised into a computer program. Those skills are beneficial for end-user programmers in order to model a task for being tackled with computational tools, e.g. spreadsheets, domain specific and visual languages. TAPASPlay is an engaging GBL platform designed to help end-user to learn algorithmic thinking.

AB  - The pervasiveness of computer devices in everyday situations poses a fundamental question about Computer Sciences as being part of those known as basic sciences. However, it would be more beneficial not to consider computation only as a technique, but instead as a way of reasoning and problem solving. Under this perspective, there are inherent relationships among the knowledge, skills and attitudes that emanate from this field and those ones commonly related to Math. This paper discusses the relationship between the so-named Computational Thinking and the foundations of Math Education, based on a literature review. Three groups of skills that can be jointly developed by both areas are identified and some challenges and implications for education in Computer Sciences are discussed.

AB  - Computational literacies are becoming increasingly necessary for full societal participation. This paper investigates how Latine and multilingual students leverage their linguistic and cultural resources to develop coding and literacy skills. Data included interviews with Latine and multilingual students, teacher interviews, and teacher co-design meeting notes. Results showed that students learned coding and language through their families and communities, leveraged their cultural knowledge of storytelling to engage in computing, and built self-efficacy through peer support. Findings from this pilot study shed light on how to mobilize Latine and multilingual students’ rich languages and cultures for equitable computer science learning.

AB  - With the rapid development of global supply chain, the existing methodology and solution struggle to cope with the operation of complex logistics systems (CLS). Thereupon, the computational logistics is suggested systematically from the perspectives of definition evolution, conceptual architecture, problem-oriented exploration, and practical philosophy. All provide an elementary sketch and synopsis of CLS oriented scheduling and decision methodology. Subsequently, a typical application of computational logistics is discussed on a container terminal handling system (CTHS). After the abstraction and automation of container terminal-oriented logistics generalized computation, the memory access model and computing principles in computer science are transferred and integrated to propose the yard facility-block accessing and switching model (YFB-ASM). The processor affinity, spatial locality and cooperative computing of CTHS are discussed according to the practice data in a large-scale CTHS. The YFB-ASM is supposed to establish a solid foundation for rolling plan, task scheduling, resource allocation and performance analysis of CTHS. It illustrates the feasibility, availability, credibility and practicability of computational logistics preliminarily.

AB  - Given the pervasive reliance on technology in modern society, teaching Computational Thinking (CT) abilities is becoming increasingly relevant. These abilities, such as modeling and coding, have become crucial for a larger audience of students, not only those who wish to become software engineers or computer scientists. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provide powerful assistance to complete computational tasks, by simplifying code generation and debugging, and potentially enhancing interactive learning. However, it is not clear if these advances make CT tasks more accessible and inclusive for all students, or if they further contribute to a digital skills divide, favoring the top students. To address this gap, we have created and evaluated a novel learning scenario for transversal CT skills that leveraged LLMs as assistants. We conducted an exploratory field study during the spring semester of 2022, to assess the effectiveness and user experience of LLM-augmented learning. Our results indicate that the usage of ChatGPT as a learning assistant improves learning outcomes. Furthermore, contrary to our predictions, the usage of ChatGPT by students does not depend on prior CT capabilities and as such does not seem to exacerbate prior inequalities.

AB  - The broad-scale emergence of AI in industry calls forth basic questions in terms of the knowledge bases and approaches relevant for its design. Engineering design has been mainly developed for electromechanical artifacts. In practice, this has meant that the scientific knowledge required for creating technical artifacts such as engines, cars, ships, cranes, telephones, radios, TVs, and simple data processing units has been natural science. However, one cannot find intelligent processes by means of physics and chemistry. Natural scientific phenomena follow their deterministic laws, but intelligence is based on selection and decision processes. The conceptual landscape of natural science is optimized for different kinds of phenomena than intelligent information processing. Consequently, the basic research under technology design should be rethought in light of the emergence of AI. To grasp intelligent information processing, we need concepts and approaches suited for the task. To create intelligent technologies on this basis, we need concepts and approaches that afford the operationalization of such information in artificial systems. We suggest that psychology of thinking and cognitive modeling provide a logical basis for future AI design.

AB  - This article discusses the latest developments of the Sucre4Stem tool, as part of the Sucre initiative, which aims to promote interest in computational thinking and programming skills in K-12 students. The tool follows the Internet of Things approach and consists of two prominent components: 1) SucreCore and 2) SucreCode. SucreCore incorporates an advanced microcontroller packaged in a more compact design and enables wireless connectivity. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, supports two different sets of blocks depending on the education grade, and facilitates wireless communication with SucreCore. At the educational level, Sucre4Stem fosters new group dynamics and encourages students to experiment real-world projects by promoting the “programming to learn” approach to concepts from other disciplines as opposed to the strategy widely applied in schools of “learning to program” in isolation.

AB  - The concept of systems thinking (and its embodiment in systems approach and systems science) dates from the historical origins of engineering, policy, and philosophy. However, unlike mathematics, physics, biology, and other fields with similar histories, systems thinking lacks a common language that facilitates transparent communication across domains. Examples from the authors' research and from literature show that research in and the practice of systems thinking would benefit from a common language and foundation of systems thinking. We present for discussion the results of our metathinking approach to a standard lexicon of systems thinking, i.e., the Dimensions of Systems Thinking. We also introduce key concepts including the observer effect of systems thinking, the difference between the scope of the analysis and the boundaries of the system, and the distinction between the metrics and indices of performance of a system. The way forward will be to discuss and debate the elements of the language of systems thinking, to establish criteria for evaluating the quality of systems thinking, and to test this methodology on case studies.

AB  - Security for every organization in the digital space is of primary focus and to better highlight and define the strategies to keep the systems safe and secure is of prime importance. While unauthorized access and unethical actions by intruders remain a cause of concern, ensuring the right measures through proper Threat Modelling techniques is necessary to create a barrier against them. The intention of getting access to a system or website or server can be born out of multiple threat groups and can be classified into common security threats. This paper looks at a persona-based approach to identify user groups that can be a threat to a system and how we can use the concepts of Design Thinking to model the system and protect it from possible security breaches. Considering the agile methodologies of software development, the paper talks about focusing on a perspective that discusses a design methodology by keeping the individuals and interactions for working models at the top of threat modelling measures.

AB  - In the realm of computational physics education, enhancing student engagement remains a pivotal challenge. This research delved into the potential of Project-Based Learning (PBL), with a particular emphasis on the VBA Physics Simulation, to invigorate students’ learning engagement. By surveying undergraduate students’ perceptions in computational physics course, we observed a predominant positive response towards the PBL model. The findings underscore that students not only appreciate the structured learning experience PBL offers but also value the guidance from lecturers in this approach. Through the lens of PBL, students reported a marked improvement in various skills, including the 4C skills (Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, Creativity), problem-solving, and higher-order thinking skills. This study advocates for the broader integration of PBL in computational physics course, especially using tools like VBA Physics Simulation, as a means to deepen understanding and amplify student engagement. We also recommend future quantitative research to further solidify these findings.

In the paper, we first present several definitions extracted from a number of relevant publications. Then, the main elements included in these definitions are analyzed. The analysis shows that such definitions are ambiguous and heterogeneous. Depending on each specific definition, they refer to concepts, skills, attitudes and transversal competences. Finally, the paper includes a section where these findings are analyzed and potential risks are identified.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a thought process designed to help students better solve complex problems using mental tools such as decomposition, abstraction, heuristics, data collection, algorithms, modeling, and communication (Wing, 2006). This study is part of a larger National Science Foundation funded STEM+C (computing) study that integrates CT in informal STEM learning. The informal STEM+CT curriculum resulted from the large study was guided by project-based learning (PBL) to help 4th to 6th grade students practice CT in the context of problem solving. Twenty-four teachers have worked with small groups of students in an afterschool community center program over an 8-weeks period. The larger STEM+C study also encouraged teachers in adapting the informal STEM+CT curriculum in their own classrooms, which eight of the 24 teachers have done so. This study investigates the participating teacher's perspective on implementing CT into elementary classrooms after they had facilitated the STEM+CT curriculum in community centers' after-school programs via interviewing 12 of the 24 teachers. The current study focuses on the challenges and issues regarding implementing CT in elementary classrooms. The results show that teachers collectively place the lack of time and the lack of professional development as the major obstacles in integrating CT into elementary classrooms.

AB  - Currently, there is a daily evolution of the world and our current digital society faces challenges for changing the environment. Currently, learning environments are undergoing an evolution due the increasing development of mobile technologies. Designing and implementing Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) has emerged to enhance the learning process and the creation of content. In this paper, we are interested on SLE. Our objective is to propose a new pedagogical approach to provide adaptive and personalized open learning based on Computational Thinking (CT). This contribution describes the main theoretical relationships between SLE, Open Learner Model, Open Education Resource, Open Practice and Open Pedagogy when developing SLE to promote the learning process. New pedagogical approaches, based on openness, need to be implemented. The goal is to orchestrate between different features of SLE in order to propose a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). We focus in particular on the pedagogical scenario that will be deployed in a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). The proposed scenario is promoted by Smart Open Pedagogy to enhance CT. We aim to deliver open assessment adapted to specific learner context profile, progress and CT’s Level in the learning.

AB  - In order to expand opportunities to learn computer science (CS), there is a growing push for inclusion of CS concepts and practices, such as computational thinking (CT), in required subjects like science. Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science. For each model in the typology, we characterize how CT+S integration is accomplished, the ways in which CT learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms.

AB  - Recent years have seen a high volume of computational thinking (CT) review studies. However, there have been no existing studies that map these reviews with the goal of achieving comprehensive understanding of the field of CT. This paper utilizes Tikva & Tambouris’ (2021) K-12 CT research domain conceptual model as the basis for identifying and defining CT reviews, then maps the identified 38 CT reviews onto the identified domains. We pinpoint eight potential future review topics, including "communities" of tools, "modeling simulations," "problem-solving" and "scaffolding" of learning strategies, "demographic attributes" of factors, "practices" and "perspectives" of the knowledge-based areas, and the "teacher training" of capacity building. We also examine the topical keywords of the reviews and identify that the scope of the term "unplugged" is vaguely defined among the existing research, suggesting a need to refine the definition of this frequently discussed topic so as to be able to more effectively conduct supplementary reviews. Our results help to better understand the CT review field and formulate future directions.

AB  - In order to simulate creative design thinking of human being and then improve those product design methods commonly used, a model of creative thinking consisting of alternant emanative and converging thinking was put forth. These shortages in case-based reasoning (CBR) and genetic algorithms (GA) were analyzed by the model. It was proved that the fundamental reason of these shortages is that they only can simulate a single process in the model of creative thinking. Then a simulation algorithm of directed similarity association is brought forward so as to realize the computation of similarity degree of product demand between components, and simulate the whole model of creative thinking by combining CBR and GA. A corresponding product design system was put forward, and then an experiment was conducted, and the results show that the combined intelligent algorithm has good performance in search.

AB  - At present, innovation courses for college students play a vital role in universities. It has also become an important teaching platform for cultivating superior talents. How to improve the level of innovative thinking of college students into high-quality national strategic talents has become a research topic of great concern. However, many university teachers still follow traditional instructional design. It is impossible to implement a customized approach to education. Responding to the deficiencies in the instructional design of innovative training for university students, the support vector machine and K-means clustering algorithms are combined to create a revolutionary network instructional system, which is then used in an undergraduate course. A virtual reality classroom, real-time chat features, and an evaluation system are just a few of the elements that make up this system. It makes it possible to personalize learning, share open data, have real-time debates, and participate in a variety of virtual learning activities. Through the use of conventional datasets, this integrated multi-algorithmic system’s dependability is illustrated. It can meet the diverse learning needs of college students and help solve the weaknesses of traditional instructional design. Since 2022, four evaluation techniques have been used to confirm the efficacy of this teaching strategy: student recognition analysis, final test passing rate, competition winning percentage, and classroom activity level assessment. The results support the following: Compared with the traditional teaching design, the novel network instructional system is more conducive to helping college students cultivate learning interests and enhance their innovative thinking level. The adoption and dissemination of this strategy will undoubtedly advance educational research and improve college students’ capacity for creative thought, fostering the development of top-notch creative talent and advancing sustainable societal development.

AB  - Today's digital society has turned the development of students' computational thinking capabilities into a critical factor for their future success. As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim.

AB  - Sorting is an algorithmic concept that is covered in every fundamental computer science and engineering course and included in most if not all programming competitions. It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges. Most notably, they were able to comprehend the concepts of sorting algorithms and the computational steps behind them, and gain a better understanding of computational thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental analytical ability to solve problems, design systems, and understand human behavior based on the fundamental concepts of computer science. The concept of computational thinking is almost needed on every profession in the computerization of society. Teaching computational thinking to cultivate problem solving ability by computer is a challenge of computer science education, especially for the K-12 level. Although studies introduce computational concepts by programming design, computational thinking and computer science are not computer programming. The study uses social simulation content (i.e. NetLogo, which uses muti-agent technology) to scaffold learning computational thinking concepts, such as simple genetic algorithm, parallel computing, artificial neural net, or deadlock (such as dining philosophers). To stimulate learning transfer onto computational thinking, NetLogo models library will be used to motivate reflection and meta-cognition development. Preliminary experimental results came from both questionnaires and artifacts. In the future, Gero's (1990) function-behaviour-structure (FBS) ontology will be used for the qualitative analysis to explain the outcomes of learning transfer.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is a set of thinking processes used by computer scientists to formulate problems and describe solutions. In recent years, CT has been largely explored by the Computing Education community. Due to its potential to contribute to problem solving and analytical thinking, CT could also be a relevant subject in K-12 education. For such, there is a need to qualify educators in CT. In this paper, we describe our experience in a large-scale course on Computational Thinking for pre-service teachers. Our goal is to qualify pre-service teachers in CT, both in the comprehension of its definition and how it can be incorporated in classroom. Our experience indicates that the participants had a positive awareness of CT concepts, as well as an adequate understanding of the pedagogical approaches to teach the subject. They also developed positive attitudes towards the field of Computer Science.

AB  - Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. This course will look at the synergies that are required across the stack from new devices to new computational models for designing future computing systems. This course will enable attendees to understand the inter-twined nature of design optimization that requires one to interact with experts in different domains. The students will be exposed to simulation tools and modelling techniques to help explore new circuits and architectures. As physical dimensional scaling alone has ceased to be the key factor driving the industry, many innovations have occurred in designing new types of logic switches including changes to their structure (such as three-dimensional FinFETs), their underlying physics (use of tunneling for steep-switching devices), the material systems (integration of ferro-electrics in gate stack for Negative Capacitance FETs). The first part of the lecture will introduce these devices, simulation models and accompanying circuit innovations. There has been a world of revolution in the memory devices with the emergence of many nonvolatile memory technologies and their tight integration in cross-point architectures. These memory systems have enabled new styles of computing systems such as the non-volatile processor for internet of thing systems and neuromorphic computing systems for cognitive computing. The lectures will focus on the synergistic coordination in advances in devices to system design. Neuromorphic systems also leverage new advances in technology such as cross-point memory arrays to integrate computing and store. Another emerging novel computational model is based on the principle “let physics do the computation”. This technique focuses on using the intrinsic operation mechanism of devices (such as nanoscale electronic coupled oscillators) to do the computation, instead of building complex circuits with standard transistors to carry out the same function. The primary objective is to train the next generation researchers and practitioners that can understand the synergy across the stack from devices to applications. This will prepare the next generation workforce for the beyond Moore era using post-CMOS devices and new computational paradigms beyond Von-Neumann computing models. This course will introduce the following topics: [1] Emerging logic and memory devices: What value do they add for circuit designers/architects? [2] Circuit/Architecture design using Emerging Logic and Memory devices [3] Neuromorphic and Brain-Inspired Computing using emerging devices [4] Computing Using Coupled Dynamical Systems.

We trained and evaluated our model using a dataset of real-world math questions. We obtained encouraging results that indicate the proposed approach may ease the process of assessing the level of alignment between math questions and Computational Thinking skills, which may help improve the problem-solving ability in students of elementary school. These results stimulate the use of automated environments for the elaboration, classification, and resolution of math questions in conformity with Computational Thinking skills.

AB  - Although Computer Science has grown to become one of the most highly demanded professional careers, every year, only a small percentage of students choose a degree directly related to Computer Science. Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of information that society has about Computer Science itself, and particularly about the work computer scientists do. No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking). In this article, we present Piens@ Computacion@ULLmente, a project that provides a methodology to promote Computer Science through Computational Thinking activities among primary and secondary education students. The results obtained from an exhaustive statistical analysis of the data we collected demonstrate that the perception of Computer Science that pre-university students have can be improved through specific training. Moreover, we can also confirm that the performance of pre-university students involving Computational Thinking skills is independent of gender, particularly at the primary education level.

AB  - This paper describes the CSER Digital Technologies MOOC curriculum, which aims to build confidence and awareness of fundamental computational thinking skills for teachers within the K-6 context. The CSER MOOC builds upon recent advances in the development of the Australian Curriculum Digital Technologies learning area, which explicitly addresses the development of computational thinking skills, moving ICT education away from digital literacy towards embedding the skills needed for the next generation to become creators of technology. The CSER MOOC presents a broad coverage of core computational thinking concepts, with a focus on integrating with existing learning areas and appropriate pedagogy for the K-6 context. In this paper, we discuss our course curriculum, its alignment with key concepts from the formal curriculum statements, example teacher assessments, and discuss key challenges and concerns.

AB  - Based on the analysis of some famous instructional cases in programming education and in-depth interviews with primary school teachers who are engaged in programming education, this paper focuses on the instructional procedure and strategies of primary school programming education for cultivating students' computational thinking. This examination reveals the current situation and possible problems in the practice of cultivating computational thinking and provide some useful references. Continuous comparison are used to code and analyze the interview data. The article founds that the instructional procedure of cultivating computational thinking in programming education generally involves five major stages: knowledge review, new knowledge exploration, problem analysis, programming on computer, and the stage of reflection. Instructional strategies accordingly include: mind map-supported, unplugged programming, flow chart use, pair programming, log reflection, and more. Finally, the paper concludes with the problems that appeared in teaching, especially in the stage of new knowledge exploration, unplugged programming and pair-programming.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is considered as the skill of 21st century. The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable. In spite of the fact that some items are suggested to be revised since the item discrimination values, the distribution of difficulties, and distractor points are less than the expected threshold.

AB  - Computation of time-dependent electromagnetic field excited by a varying current distribution is the hardcore of modern computational electromagnetism. However, differing from other computing forms of field problem described by partial differential equations, the computation of electromagnetic field did not really use series of the general, abstract and formalized methods. And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic. In reverse, if a general mathematical model is perfect in logic, it can not only allow us to effectively use the computation methods supplied by computational mathematics but also provide more full and more exact information about electromagnetic field.

AB  - Central to the theory of learning are inquiry-based approaches to education. Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities.

AB  - In the context of digitalization, employing the dual-diamond model design thinking, we dissect the design of smart tourism systems to enhance user-centric experiences. Firstly, through a literature review, we delve into the concept and design process of the dual-diamond model while exploring the feasibility of digital technologies. Subsequently, harnessing the characteristics of the dual-diamond design thinking, we embark on the entire design process. During the exploration phase, we gather firsthand user pain points through user interviews, complemented by secondary data from the internet. This aids in constructing user journey maps and user models, defining user segments, and identifying design opportunities. Following this, we proceed with the functional reconstruction and interface prototyping of the smart tourism application, with a focus on features such as automated travel guides, visualized travel itineraries, panoramic guides, personalized travel companion searches, and intelligent user interactions. Conducting empirical design validation, we observed a high level of user satisfaction. Consequently, iterative design improvements were made, serving as a reference for future smart travel service promotion and development, thus advancing the growth of personalized tourism.

AB  - This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years old). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better “logical thinking”) is applicable not only to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited for decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called “moral machines," using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a “right” versus “wrong” answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.

AB  - A series of unplugged programming courses based on game activities has been designed and developed to reduce the difficulty of programming courses in elementary school and to develop computational thinking skills in elementary school students. Four components were designed for the course: course objectives, course content, course activities, and course evaluation. A controlled experiment was performed to validate the course's influence on developing learners' computational thinking, and a questionnaire was employed to examine the experimental class learners' experience with the course. The results found that the level of computational thinking in the experimental class was also significantly different from the pretest, and the students in the experimental class rated each item of the course above 7 points. This indicates that this course has a significant effect on cultivating students' computational thinking, and the learners had a good learning experience and made gains from this course.

AB  - This paper focuses on game development using Mixed Reality technology, the Magic Leap One device, by exploring with The Lab and Unreal Engine program that are developed in game interpolating Computational Thinking (CT). The research device focuses on integrating thinking skills into 3D games with real-time user interaction. From mixed reality (MR) the application of technology is evaluated in its use for learning effectiveness. The game aims to promote a computational thinking process based on the terms and conditions within 5 levels as well as the complexity of the game with more obstacles in each level as the character travels from beginning to destination. Commands provide for different contexts. Major goal is using mixed reality technology to advance convergence in computing education and training in computational thinking (CT) to help players strengthen their thinking process and CT through the game. This game can be an alternative learning medium for the educator in primary school (Grade 4–6). The assessment of target users 10–15 persons before and after the game tests have 3 aspects in technology, CT, and usability of game performance. An expert evaluation was conducted after the test. Assessment of the overall game focuses on building of CT skill within the game relative to project objectives. Evaluation results were 77.8% by users and 88.6% by the expert. Furthermore, some useful suggestions from assessment suggest adding workshop guidelines for educators or trainers. Thus, this project contributes to the computing education community by using available cutting-edge technology as an optional teaching tool in CT that suits learners in education at the primary level and looks toward future development for higher education.

AB  - In the last years, many didactic activities have been proposed to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills in children and adolescents. Among these activities, the digital game programming stands out as a promising alternative considering that it is related to a familiar and motivating context for students. These initiatives are not specifically aimed at individuals with special needs such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children and adolescents with ASD usually have some limitations related to communication, cognitive flexibility, and interpersonal relationships. However, it seems natural that the skills potentially developed through game programming activities are especially beneficial for the public with ASD. In this paper, we describe the offering and evaluation of a Game Building Workshop adapted to adolescents with this condition. The guidelines used to define the workshop activities are described. An assessment based on the classroom observation and analysis of produced artifacts indicate that the participants acquired CT skills related to programming at a high level. In addition, the collaborative nature of the activities offered a stimulating and welcoming environment for individuals with ASD.

AB  - While specialized knowledge and skills are the hallmark of modern society, the size and complexity of contemporary problems often require cooperative effort to analyze and solve. Therefore, experiences with skills, methodologies, and tools for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and structured problem solving are vital for preparing students for future academic and professional success. Meanwhile, computational systems have permeated much of modern professional and personal life, making computational thinking an essential skill for members of modern society. However, formal training in these techniques is primarily limited to students within computer science, mathematics, management of information systems, and engineering. At Iowa State University, we have designed and offered an experimental course to develop undergraduate students' abilities for interdisciplinary teamwork and to disseminate computational thinking skills to a broader range of students. This novel course was jointly designed and instructed by faculty from the Computer Science Department, Gerontology Program, and Graphic Design Program to incorporate diverse faculty expertise and pedagogical approaches. Students were required to interview real users to identify real-life problems, gather requirements, and assess candidate solutions, which necessitated communication both within the group and with technologically-disinclined users. In-class presentations and wiki-based project websites provided regular practice at disseminating domain expertise to larger interdisciplinary audiences. Workshops, group-based mentoring, peer learning, and guided discovery allowed non-CS majors to learn much more about computer programs and tools, and grading criteria held students individually accountable within their disciplines but also emphasized group collaboration

AB  - Until now, significant R&D effort in the field of Computational Creativity, has been devoted towards understudying the elements of the creative process from idea conception to production, or towards designing machines which exhibit human level creativity without merely mimicking the human creative process. However, in the effort to determine if an artefact is creative by human standards, it is also important to examine the perception of creativity by humans and to which extend this perception can be formalized and applied on the evaluation of creative works. In this paper, we investigate how the human perception for creativity exhibited in text artefacts can be predicted using appropriate formulations of computational creativity metrics. To this end, we designed and executed a storytelling experiment assisted by the usage of computational tools. We subsequently exploited human-provided rankings of the stories in order to train a model for evaluating creativity as a combination of various characteristics of the produced stories.

AB  - The systematic solutions to planning and scheduling for container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) have been scarce owing to their high complexity and strong randomness. This paper extended the past research on modeling CTLS with computer composition principles and architecture. The comparability and the further mapping relationships between CTLS and multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) were discussed at great length within the theoretical viewpoints of computational thinking. Whereafter a container terminal logistics computational architecture was put forward for scheduling and execution using the perspective of MPSoC, which was established on the conceptual framework and fundamental principles of distributed, parallel, and cooperative computing in essence. Finally, the approach was demonstrated by investigating the stress testing, load balancing and process behavior of a typical container terminal logistics service case in contrast with the previous work based on the comprehensive computational experiments.

AB  - This abstract describes design-based research on building tools that support the development of skills which will allow learners to become producers rather than simply consumers of computational tools. Game creation is an activity which has good potential for learning skills such as multimodal writing and computational thinking skills. Existing tools make the creation of commercial quality games possible, but fall short of fulfilling the potential for skills development. Learner-centred design of a suite of tools which will guide learners towards activities with potential for the desired skills development is underway. Current progress on the design and development of tools is reported and future activities are outlined.

AB  - Any cognizable thing (object, or idea) can be recognized as a concept, and they are usually described by modality-specific, experience-dependent, or localist-distributed representations. There has been a significant effort in studying concrete concepts, along with their underlying cognitive and psychological processes through conceptual representations produced by computational approaches (like Artificial Neural Networks). However, the notion of abstract concepts, though debated, is seldom explored. In this article, we propose an approach to learn abstract representation of concepts with Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) evolving computational modeling. RANs methodology is illustrated using a toydata problem, and evaluated for metrics Precision, Recall, Fl-score, and Accuracy, along with ROC curve analysis. RANs comparison is presented using a benchmark data from human activity recognition domain, yielding Precision= 98.20% (ca.), Recall= 97.62% (ca.), Fl-score= 97.8 (ca.), and Accuracy= 97.62% (ca.). Sleep Detection data from SOCIALITE project is used to model active and inactive students, showing a convincing performance. Further, the model is used in studying 3 students in order to deduce biomarkers for understanding their psychological conditions.

AB  - In this paper we present a STEM education initiative. This initiative involves an improved learning approach by means of the implementation of collaborative learning techniques. The proposed approach promotes computational thinking skills in a group manner to improve the learning of geometry. Two case studies were performed with primary school children in the fourth grade at the Comfacor School (Montería-Colombia). The aim of these studies was to analyse the effects of the improved approach in three aspects: the children' motivation, satisfaction and performance. The obtained results provide evidence that the learning of geometry was enhanced thanks to the proposed approach implemented based on a computational thinking strategy.

AB  - This paper analyzes the efforts of DISSECT (DIScover SciEnce through Computational Thinking) to introduce computer science theories into K-12 Curricula. This is accomplished by teaching computational thinking (CT) problem solving techniques in existing STEM+C courses in select middle and high school classrooms in Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA. Data collected over the course of the fall 2014 and spring 2015 semesters involving 10 graduate fellows, 9 teachers, and over 200 K-12 students has been analyzed. A single assessment was issued at the beginning and end of each semester in order to track metrics about fellow-teacher pairings, student understanding of CT concepts, and student interest in STEM+C areas. Using statistical analysis software to evaluate the data, we were able to determine the efficacy of the DISSECT program. In particular, we use descriptive statistics to evaluate the trends in CT vocabulary recognition and overall interest in computing, and we compare trends across courses and grade levels.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) introduces computing concepts and demonstrates their usefulness in many other disciplines. CT principles such as algorithmic problem solving, abstraction, modeling and simulation, are integrated into existing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) curricula by DISSECT (DIScover SciEnce through Computational Thinking). By pairing a local K-12 teacher with a graduate fellow, DISSECT provides instruction and resources as instruments that are pertinent to each specific discipline. These skills in problem-solving and abstract reasoning are necessary for students to be able to compete in the modern and future job markets. DISSECT works to provide these skill-sets to students and classrooms that lack access to computers. The K-12 teachers and graduate fellows work together to develop modules that are capable of teaching CT concepts that are directly tied to their current curriculum while removing the need for access to computer systems. This paper will focus on the modules developed and executed in middle and high school classrooms, emphasizing the creative ways explored to operate in a computer-free environment discussing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, while qualitatively assessing student engagement, learning, and interaction which is gathered through teacher interviews, observations and informal talks with students.

AB  - Digital games are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. After realizing this, several educators have been motivated to use games as teaching and learning tools. In this sense, it is possible to involve teachers and students in the production of their own games, thus contributing both to the development of computational thinking and to acquiring knowledge related to the different disciplines involved in this process. Despite the benefits, the production of games is a complex task that requires knowledge of a specific domain and presents a significant learning curve for students and teachers. The choice of using effective strategies such as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) practices supported by a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to promote the production of games in the educational context is decisive and can favor the adoption of game-based learning. This work proposes a strategy for the specification of game design for digital games by students and teachers in the classroom, that can promote the development of computational thinking, as well as reading and writing skills.

AB  - The manual assessment of creativity by human raters is coupled with unavoidable subjectivity and often costs much time and human resources. To address these issues, this paper explores how to apply natural language processing (NLP) methods to the assessment of creativity. Using the Alternative Use Task (AUT), participants were encouraged to generate ideas as fast as possible for a fixed time. It was hypothesized that the similarity of ideas would decrease over time in the AUT, considering the design fixation and the limitation of working memory. In the first study, 12 university students completed the AUT in paper-pencil form and generated a total of 376 responses. We applied two NLP models, namely BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), to assess the similarity of responses between individuals. The results did not confirm our hypothesis. One prominent reason might be that the applied models represent millions of sentence structures that are over-ecological and too dissimilar to the sentence structures participants had used while finishing the AUT. Nevertheless, the results did show that BERT and USE could more accurately express the semantic information of responses pace with the Latent Semantic Analysis, a popular computer-aided model for AUT response assessment. In study 2, we proposed an algorithm to reanalyze the 376 responses in study 1 based on word embedding with crowdsourced responses. There were 1690 crowdsourced responses collected from 550 participants who completed an online version of the AUT. The results supported our hypothesis and showed that the similarity of responses increases as time passes. This indicates the proposed algorithm would alleviate the influence of sentence structure in AUT tasks. The differences between BERT, USE, and proposed algorithms are discussed in relation to the assessment of creativity, and the implications for future work are explored in-depth.

AB  - Block-based programming languages reduce the need to learn low-level programming syntax while enabling novice learners to focus on computational thinking skills. Game-based learning environments have been shown to create effective and engaging learning experiences for students in a broad range of educational domains. The fusion of block-based programming with game-based learning offers significant potential to motivate learners to develop computational thinking skills. A key challenge educational game developers face in creating rich, interactive learning experiences that integrate computational thinking activities is the lack of an embeddable block-based programming toolkit. Current block-based programming languages, such as Blockly and Scratch, cannot be easily embedded into industry-standard 3D game engines. This paper presents IntelliBlox, a Blockly-inspired toolkit for the Unity cross-platform game engine that enables learners to create block-based programs within immersive game-based learning environments. Our experience using IntelliBlox suggests that it is an effective toolkit for integrating block-based programming challenges into game-based learning environments.

AB  - This research-track work-in-progress paper contributes to engineering education by documenting progress in developing a new standard Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic to measure engineering student success in five factors of computational thinking. Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds. This can increase student self-efficacy, improve student retention, and improve student enculturation into the engineering profession. Currently, the diagnostic identifies general computational thinking skill

AB  - Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement.

In this paper, taking respective advantages of computer and human, we propose a novel computational knowledge environment (CKE) where human is able to cognize tacit and new knowledge for complex or ill-structured problem solving, through fusing potential knowledge discovered from the collected information data supported by computer. Following the CKE framework, we develop a creativity technique called InnoSpider which greatly support human's perception, intuition, reasoning and cognition for quick decision making. A case study have verified the effectiveness of CKE, and have indicated InnoSpider can drive human to make high-quality decisions in a shorter time.

AB  - The intelligence of human being includes three aspects, i.e. mathematics computing, logic computing and imagery thinking. There exists extraordinary unequal understanding between abstract thinking and imagery thinking while too less result on imagery thinking is ready. Simulating imagery thinking on the basis of expert experience is alternative. In the paper, Electrocardiogram recognition based on physicianspsila experiences is discussed as an example. The results demonstrate that the simulation on physicianspsila thinking process is very essential to the success of computer-aided diagnosis.

AB  - The recent urgency for counterterrorism and the fight to protect ones' homeland are of grave concern to nations throughout the world. Finding an efficient process that could have screened passengers prior to boarding a flight or even a train may have derailed many devastating events. Scientific research has continuously proved that there is an explicit marker of neuronal activity that correlates with awareness, past experience, and short-term interactions from the well-known P300 peak of an evoked potential. This study examines the effects of memory recognition to certain key stimuli mixed with irrelevant variables in an effort to identify if a trained terrorist, per se, could not only be identified from a group of subjects, but also validate that the willingness to withhold information is out of the control of the individual; it's simple, one has no control in concealing their brain's activity.

AB  - In recent years, educational research has emphasized the significance of computational thinking (CT) and mathematics knowledge acquisition for students' learning in engineering subjects. Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field.

AB  - Robot-mediated learning activities are often designed as collaborative exercises where children work together to achieve the activity objectives. Although miscommunications and misunderstandings occur frequently, humans, unlike robots, are very good at overcoming them and converging to a shared solution. With the aim of equipping a robot with these abilities and exploring its effects, in this article we investigate how a humanoid robot can collaborate with a human learner to construct a shared solution to a problem via suggesting actions and (dis)agreeing with each other. Concretely, we designed a learning activity aiming to improve the computational thinking skills of children, in which the robot makes suggestions on what to do, that may be in line with what the human thinks or not. Furthermore, the robot may suggest wrong actions that could essentially prevent them from finding a correct solution. Via a pilot study conducted remotely with 9 school children, we investigate whether the interaction results in positive learning outcomes, how the collaboration evolves, and how these relate to each other. The results show positive learning outcomes for the participants in terms of finding better solutions, suggesting that the collaboration with the robot might have helped trigger the learning mechanisms.

AB  - Programming has become a crucial skill in today’s world. Technology and computers are basically part of anything now. President Obama once referred to the importance of children learning programming: “I do not want our young people to just be consumers, I want them to be producers of this technology and to understand it, to feel like they are controlling it, as opposed to it controlling them.” It is thus an increasing need for an individual to know how to write their own programs. With the increasing dependency on computation, one can anticipate such skills being a requirement for most jobs in the coming years. There is a lot of effort done in this area, however most of them focused on either software or hardware track. The aim of this work is to test if using a hybrid approach for teaching K-12 students programming by combining both software and hardware techniques is more effective than using a singleton approach.

AB  - This Research Full Paper introduces a model for structuring playful, challenge-based learning activities drawing on a process of decontextualisation of a challenge to access its Computational Thinking intellectual and conceptual components and subsequent computationalisation of these components into computational artifacts that are recontextualised to render them attractive and accessible to school pupils. The case study follows a thick description approach to evaluating the engagement potential of the instructional design, as well as the didactic choices made during implementation. We conclude that Bebras cards and Dash robots provide considerable support for a playful engagement with computational concepts and engaging children with different scientific backgrounds in Computational Thinking. In particular, flexibility in how they are used and easy adaptation of challenge level make them useful in contexts with broad participation. Additionally we find that using robots to provide a link between the theoretical presentation of CT in the Bebras card and a physical representation and programming challenge is engaging and helps participants to focus on algorithmic concepts.

AB  - Computer programming is being introduced in schools worldwide as part of a movement that promotes Computational Thinking (CT) skills among young learners. In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners -even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning- still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations.

AB  - The primary issue of garbage is its direct impact on the environment and quality of life. Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don’t use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called “Trashman”. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer’s expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game’s end. This will evaluate player’s performance of CT through their ability separating trash. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals can be applied for lifelong learning to follow-up and assessment in furtherance of correct trash sorting.

AB  - Research-based learning (RBL) familiarizes students with the academic research process at an early stage and at the same time offers them the opportunity to actively shape their own learning process. Working on their own research problems allows students to go through the entire research cycle, which promotes not only subject and methodological competencies but also the students' self-competencies. The handling of subject-specific and didactic challenges of this form of teaching-learning has been discussed many times in the past. New challenges for research-based learning now arise from the shift of teaching and learning to virtual space associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the adaptation of a research-based teaching-learning format to the demands of e-learning in the course Interaction Science with Artificial Intelligence. We evaluated the adapted teaching-learning format with 18 students in a master's program in STEM. The students stated an increase in professional competence in the areas of programming, data preparation and data visualization. Our results suggest that peer group and direct interaction via synchronous communication channels are important structural frameworks for research-based learning in an online learning context. From our results, we can derive initial implications for online-based RBL in the field of computational education.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of the algorithmic expressions for the assessment tools for assessing algorithmic thinking ability of elementary school children. In Japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan. There were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. By answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15. The scores were statistically analyzed.

AB  - In this paper we describe our process for synthesizing frameworks for recognizing student talents in the areas of Computational Thinking (CT) and Engineering Design (ED) from prior research. Computer science education research has resulted in multiple, overlapping definitions of CT as an approach towards solving problems using methods and tools that are derived from computer science. Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers. Through the analysis of teacher surveys and interviews from 19 classroom implementations, we evaluated the changes that the Arts & Bots program has had on teacher perceptions of student CT and ED skills and talents.

In particular, there have been studied various educational models such as theory, practice, and project classes in SW education programs. In this study, we aim to verify whether the SW education program has a significant effect on computational thinking and communication skills by using the communication-centered model (C-UMC), which centers on ‘communication’ as one of the characteristics of the metaverse. The SW education program applied in this study targets 23 high school students and is conducted for 16 sessions (2 hours × 8 sessions). This study is an ongoing research, and we presented the design process for conducting the study, as well as the current classroom process and preliminary results. For further study, we will perform an effectiveness analysis on whether there was a significant difference in learners' computational thinking and communication skills.

AB  - Peter: Many thanks to Dorothy Denning, my wife, who listened to my many speeches about computing for nearly 50 years and kept me channeled in productive directions. Much appreciation to my friend Fernando Flores, for teaching me how to read history for the concerns that emerge from it and thus discern different stages of computational thinking over the centuries. To the founders of computing and computing education whom I met through ACM, including Eckert, Mauchly, Perlis, Newell, Simon, Forsythe, Conte, Wilkes, Hamming, Knuth, and Dijkstra. To my teachers at MIT who turned this electrical engineer into one of the first holders of a computer science degree, especially Fano, Corbato, Dennis, Saltzer, Scherr, and Zadeh. To my many colleagues in computer science and engineering over the years, too numerous to mention by name here, who engaged me in edifying conversations about computing.

AB  - The United States (U.S.) is going through a preschool through 12th grade education transition to Common Core State Standards (CCSS), initially English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics (Math). Computational and model thinking can lead to a practice of computer coding where many of the necessary shifts in learning the ELA and Math standards can be incorporated. A new initiative by Paradise Valley Unified School District (PVUSD) to teach coding to K-8 students, and the requisite computational/model thinking through CCSS activities and lesson plans is provided. Three Gifted Education teachers (1st/2nd grades, 3rd/4th grades, 5th/6th grades) and the Information Technology Director articulate and showcase some explorations of teaching computer coding. The teachers and their students have been exposed to a variety of computational/model thinking activities and web portals/platforms (e.g., Codecademy, Scratch, App Inventor, Khan Academy, etc.), IOS/Android Apps, and web sites as listed at http://ccc.pvlearners.net. All students have access to tablets, Chromebooks, and TelePresence units to facilitate their creation and collaboration in coding.

AB  - In this paper, we describe on-going work on the ensemble of two models for computational creativity using commonsense knowledge. The GENCAD model of computational creativity proposes the use of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that employs a population of exemplars as a starting point for its search, unlike traditional EAs, which employ a randomly-generated initial population. The EA, operating on this population, is then used to generate new potentially creative solutions. GENCAD has been instantiated in the domains of structural design of tall buildings and feng shui-compliant residential floor-plan design. The MEXICA model of computational creativity also begins with a set of exemplars as a starting point, but it analyzes these exemplars based on a domain theory. The generalized model that is obtained from analyzing the set of exemplars is then used to guide the generation of new solutions. MEXICA has been instantiated in the domain of plot generation for stories involving themes, characters and locations from the Mexica culture of ancient Mexico. In the hybrid model, we combine the two original models to generate plots for stories of the same sort that MEXICA generates, but using GENCAD's process model to do so. To confirm that the generated plots make sense, the hybrid model integrates commonsense knowledge into its evaluation module.

AB  - Summary <p>Critical Systems Thinking (CST) is a systems approach that aims to assist decision&#x2010;makers to better understand and address the complex issues they face. This chapter looks at the origins and early development of CST. A brief account of the state of Systems Thinking (ST) in the early 1980s is necessary to discern the reasons for the emergence of the approach. The development of CST is then traced to 1991. By that time, it had become formalised around a set of three commitments, to which it has largely remained true. The first, &#x2018;systemic critique&#x2019;, insists that all systems approaches are partial, and this leads to their different strengths and weaknesses. The second, &#x2018;systemic pluralism&#x2019;, suggests that the maximum benefit can be obtained by using systems methodologies in combination during an intervention. The third, &#x2018;systemic improvement&#x2019;, explains what improvement means in systems terms and how it can be pursued. The case is then made for CST to embrace a fourth commitment, to &#x2018;systemic pragmatism&#x2019;. It is argued that this can support the other three and take CST forward.</p>

AB  - In recent years there is a growing interest in including programming activities in education, emphasizing the importance of children developing computer thinking since early ages. Block-based programming environments scaffold children to explore and learn programming in an easier way. In this paper we present a project supported by a theoretical framework that mobilizes constructionism, the maker movement, tinkering, and project-based learning, and a practical framework based on workshops with primary teachers. Primary school children developed computational thinking and creative computing skills, while they design and present ideas to turn their city a smart city. Results show the quality of the products developed using programming and robots and the impact that this approach can have in authentic learning.

AB  - Student who possess several qualities of intelligence and critical thinking skills are believed to think independently. To develop overall skills for a student, it is required that a student demonstrate his knowledge, skills, and abilities in a various ways i.e., through multiple choice questions, fill the gaps, problem solving, short and long answers. Assessment of short and long/essay answers is hectic and tedious tasks for several teachers. Learning Management Systems provide an opportunity to learn online. To develop critical thinking in an online environment, it is necessary to conduct exams and assessment online. Most online LMS tools support assessment through multiple choice questions, but these tools test only higher order thinking skills. Many researchers have tried to provide a system to automatically assess short and long/essay answers using several different approaches. The objective of survey is to highlight problems associated with the evaluator, discuss difficulties and limitations of online tools. In this literature, the methodologies used to develop various models of short answer grading given by several authors and their results are discussed. This paper highlights drawbacks/difficulties with automatic short answers grading. Authors tried to discuss the scope for researchers in this field of automated grading using machine learning algorithms. Authors recommend researchers to conduct an experiment in hybrid and feedback supported systems for grading answers.

AB  - Intrinsic Motivation Inventory is a self-report instrument used to assess participants' experience regarding a particular activity. This paper examined the psychometric properties of a revised Intrinsic Motivation Inventory in the context of computational thinking learning. A total of 400 students from 4th grade participated in the pilot study. The revised instrument measured students' intrinsic motivation from four dimensions: interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, value/usefulness, and relatedness. The main findings of the study are twofold: (1) primary school students showed moderate to high motivation to learn computational thinking through programming and CS Unplugged; (2) factor analysis revealed that single factor model and multifactor model had good fit indices. However, discriminant validity of multifactor model was poor, suggesting the existence of a general factor.

AB  - This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an exploratory study investigating the impact of using a Bee-Bot educational robot simulator to enhance learning sequencing concepts and student motivation among Macao primary school students. Sequencing in computational thinking (CT) is understanding and applying the logical order of steps in problem-solving processes. We introduced a Bee-Bot computer simulator for children to learn sequencing. Our study adopted a pretest-posttest method involving 35 grade two students. The Computational Thinking Test for Beginners (BCTt) was used to assess CT abilities, and the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was utilized to measure learning motivation. We found a significant improvement in sequencing ability and more advanced CT concepts (loops and conditions) and a significant correlation between those concepts. Departing from the existing literature, we delved deeper into how Bee-Bot's influence on sequencing extended to more advanced CT concepts. Moreover, considering the ARCS motivation model, this study examined how Bee-Bot affects learning motivation at the primary education level. After the intervention, the findings revealed that the students showed significantly higher learning motivation, meaning that the different learning activities using the Bee-Bot simulator positively influenced various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. The correlation between the IMMS scores and the BCTt outcomes further suggested that enhanced motivation positively correlated with better CT abilities.

AB  - This study analyzes 15,453 math topic-based Scratch projects of the online Scratch community to find the relations among K–12 math topics, usage of 13 programming elements, and project popularity. Among the six math topics, only statistics and calculus significantly contribute to projecting popularity. In addition, noncore programming elements, including sound and look, are widely adapted across various math topics and contribute significantly to project popularity. Although some studies discussed the integration of computation thinking (CT) and math in the classrooms, scant research focuses on the effect of math topics on CT element adoption for achieving better integration in the creative learning context. Moreover, few studies involve a large sample size for generalizable findings.

AB  - Can digital competencies be acquired by solving real problems? The educational intervention MadeByKids called an external educational provider to 17 schools to conduct a series of workshops, having pupils age 7 - 12 solve challenges such as designing the schoolbag 4.0 or the future classroom. The workshops were designed by adopting the Stanford Design Thinking Method for Kids (http://www.ideaco.org) and digital technologies with the goal to “teach” children computational thinking, collaborating in teams, resolving conflicts, presenting, giving/receiving feedback, etc. In this paper, we take a participatory action research (PAR) approach with the goal of exposing significant chunks of the incredibly rich experience. A content analysis of a qualitative survey among teachers and findings from a focus group reflect the teachers' view. The study indicates that the acquisition of digital competences needs to be backed by personal and social capacities that take time to mature. Furthermore, we learned that the children's teachers must be included consistently to ensure their cooperation and improve sustainability. Besides providing inspiration for teachers, implications for teacher education are derived and the national project is related to the findings from studies conducted abroad in order to contribute to constructive educational innovations crossing national boundaries.

AB  - This research paper examined theories, pedagogics, and contents explored by studies focusing on promoting computational thinking (CT) in higher education institutions (HEIs). CT has become a fundamental approach to building problem-solving skills, which requires a thought process. The field of CT is generally still maturing, and the use of CT as an approach to introduce freshmen to introductory programming courses in HEIs has been gaining scholars' interest in the recent past. To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field. A literature review methodology was adopted in this study. The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI. Additionally, the study revealed that activity-based learning, problem-based learning, automatic assessment-based learning, and self-regulated or self-reflective learning are the prominent pedagogies used by educators. These findings provided a strong foundation for research in this growing field. Besides, the findings also create an opportunity for positioning CT in HEI's educational curriculum regarding how CT should be taught in that context.

AB  - While programming has been recognized as an engaging way to enhance students’ learning, implementing programming in K-12 education remains challenging, particularly when it requires access to digital devices or the internet. Therefore, it’s essential to consider more accessible methods for teaching crucial programming skills. Given this situation, we turned to unplugged computational thinking (CT) activities to foster interest and develop skills in programming. By introducing programming concepts through unplugged CT activities, this research significantly contributed to the growth of interest and the development of skills among secondary school students. Two hundred and thirty lower secondary school students volunteered to participate in the intervention using a designed unplugged CT activity framework. The CT activities framework consists of four components: puzzles, the Bebras Computing Challenge, problem-solving, and programming concepts. Four schools participated in three- to four-day interventions for four to five hours daily. Quantitative data collection was performed using pre- and post-surveys before and after the intervention phase. A paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated the p-value < 0.05 suggested a significant improvement in interest and programming skills. An overall findings implied that the unplugged CT activities enhanced students’ understanding of CT as well as improved their interest and programming skills.

AB  - The advancement in Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) technology resulted in accurate and high-performance miniature device systems. These devices are so tiny that they are not noticeable by the human eye and exhibit excellent feasibility in miniaturization sensors due to their small dimensions, low power consumption, and superior performance. The area of sci-ence and engineering where MEMS are developed (dimensions in the manometer scale) is called Nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is one of the fastest growing scientific research related to Industry 4.0. Nanotechnology may introduce industrial skills deficits as well as opportunities for new teaching practices in several subjects and educational frameworks. In the present work, we investigate the attitude of STEM (i.e. technology/engineering) and non STEM - related instructors, regarding the integration of Nanotechnology applications in Higher education curricula. Their opinions, concerning the applied teaching method, the learning content material and expected student skills, should always be taken in to account, as they may boost any reformations proposed. Moreover, we propose a repository platform, with which instructors may interact with 3D designs and MEMs mate-rial to built their didactic plans. This work's findings is critical for the design and innovative training material and computational thinking (CT) activities, which will prepare student with skills related to Industry 4.0 demand.

AB  - This research to practice work in progress paper explores changes in teachers' knowledge of integrating computational thinking (CT) into early childhood education in a professional learning (PL) initiative. The main goal of the program is to prepare teachers to develop CT practices into early childhood learning environments by fostering several key components: recognizing the significance of CT development from early childhood, applying pedagogical practices (i.e. unplugged activities, Use-Modify-Create), identifying socially constructed roles and stereotypes surrounding toys, implications of screen and device usage in learning, and developing skills to design CT learning activities tailored for their own classroom settings. To achieve our goals, the research team designed, implemented, and evaluated an online 30-hour PL program with educators from Latin American countries. Approximately 80 teachers completed the online PL program. The participating teachers engaged with the PL program weekly by providing written journal reflections. In the final week, they were asked to design a lesson based on what they learned and implement it into their classroom. Teachers completed a pre- and post-survey surrounding their self-efficacy and technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) in CT. Data sources include pre- and post-surveys, teacher journal reflections, and lesson plans developed by teachers. In this paper, we analyzed their journal reflections to qualitatively develop an understanding of how teachers progressed in the PL. The lesson plans will be analyzed to identify: (1) the learning goals for the students, (2) which activities teachers preferred to implement, and (3) how they assessed student learning in CT in their classroom. Preliminary findings demonstrate the types of CT activities they implemented in their classrooms. Teachers also created lessons that met their students' needs which further provides examples of how CT is integrated within the existing curriculum surrounding student interest and culture. Many PL programs often teach about CT concepts, but do not offer a chance to implement a lesson plan and reflect on their experience. This process helps teachers develop self-efficacy for teaching CT in an elementary classroom and teachers reported that they would continue to integrate CT within their future instruction. Also, this program contributes to the reduction of the gender gap in CT, promoting equitable practices in early childhood education.

AB  - In order to explore creativity in design, a computational model based on CBR (an approach to employing old experiences to solve new problems) and other soft computing techniques from machine learning, is proposed in this paper. The new model is able to address four challenging issues: generation of a design prototype from incomplete requirements; judgment and improvement of system performance given a sparse initial case base library; extraction of critical features from a given feature space; adaptation of retrieved previous solutions to similar problems for deriving a new solution to a given design task. The core principle employed by this model is that different knowledge from various level cases can be explicitly explored and integrated into a practical design process.

AB  - Digital tools have become more essential in education and business areas these days and it is important to start in the early stages of education, e.g. already in the preschool stage. This paper describes the development and pilot testing of an Android based serious gaming App for mobile devices called Pic2Program. The App aims to teach children the basics of Computational Thinking (CT) in a playful way. The gameplay expects the young children to steer successfully their in-game character with the help of an intuitive symbol language through a set of increasingly complex mazes. The children may even draw sets of symbols by hand thus develop a basic program. Pic2Programs image recognition module will then process these symbols by first photographing them with an Android device and then using a neural network to map the photos to program instructions. The effectivity of Pic2Program on learning CT has been evaluated by a designed course for 9th, graders. The results show that students find the App well-structured and help them to understand the basics of programming.

From this point we try, in this article, to find a common language between machine and human thinking, that is to say the use of the concepts of computer science to solve problems. We propose in this study a new methodology called “Algo-think Approch” serving as a bridge between computer processing, practiceand human activities

AB  - Aspiring software developers, like the novice students in Computer Science courses, need to acquire a thorough understanding of fundamental computational concepts like sequential execution, conditional branching, loops, modularisation, hierarchy and reuse. This understanding and "computational thinking" is deepened when they encounter the concepts in different contexts and environments, as opposed to only in one traditional programming language. In this paper, we describe how we used the Cinco Adventure Game Tool, a tool that allows students to model simple browser games in an intuitive graphical framework, to train basic computational concepts in a creative and engaging, learning-by-doing fashion. On purpose, we steered away from traditional programming languages, in order to separate the use of the concepts and constructs from the hurdle of a programming language syntax and development environment. The experiences with a large group of first-term Computer Science students in two successive years were very positive: The students had no problems in understanding and using the concepts, used the tool proficiently and enjoyed designing and modelling the games. Working together on a game project in small groups, they showed sustained engagement, developed a high level of confidence, and created quite complex games containing various fundamental computational constructs.

AB  - Fast Delivery is an educational game designed to facilitate the learning of computational thinking and development of logic, teaching the basic pillars that would be sentences, conditionals and cycles through an entertaining and innovative tool. Fast Delivery facilitates the resolution of programs because it is written in a textual programming language through a simple and intuitive pseudocode in the Spanish language. The game employs a gamified approach where users answer coding questions displayed on the screen by selecting code fragments from boxes to complete the given code. Using various associated techniques, such as gamification mechanics that will be lives and scores. And also the behavioral instruction technique that will work through visual and auditory stimuli. To evaluate the effects of the game use on learning and motivation, a study was carried out with students from a Chilean educational school. The results show that some students presented an overall learning gain, while others performed worse in the posttest than in the pretest. A motivational questionnaire based in the Self-determination Theory, supports the idea that students perceived the activity as difficult, lowering their sense of autonomy and competence, raising pressure, and thus negatively affecting motivation. Results by learning objective suggest that higher learnings were obtained for decision structures rather than for cycles and arithmetic operations with variables.

AB  - Collaborative learning has proven to be a productive approach across domains including computer science. Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi’s overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to understand the human mind functions such that we can simulate them into a computational model for making cognitive systems more intelligent. We then present this model with formulae using a top-down approach. We propose that the human thought process, which is the fundamental unit for the human mind and all the different emotions coming from it, can be implemented as a mathematical formula to a reasonable extent. Furthermore, we argue that our model has the ability to derive mind functions such as dreams and thinking. The model utilizes a top-down approach for understanding the factors involved in the thought process while explaining the factors involved. The authors are intending to make continuous improvements in the formulae as more scientific advances happen in the understanding of the human cognitive functions.

This query expansion method for information retrieval is useful, because unexpected related information can probably be obtained by adding new words to the query. The fuzzy abductive inference is the inference method based on Peng and Reggia's (1990) abductive inference. This method infers nonredundant combinations of concept words for the query. This paper also studies how to update the weights of concept-term relationships by the steepest descent method.

The model is bio mimetically inspired and adapts the neuromodulators role of human brains into computational environments. This way we aim at achieving more efficient Artificial Intelligence solutions based on the biological inspiration of the deep functioning of human brain, which is highly emotional. The analysis of new data obtained from neurology, psychology philosophy and anthropology allows us to generate a mapping of monoamine neuro modulators and to apply it to computational system parameters. Artificial cognitive systems can then better perform complex tasks (regarding information selection and discrimination, attention, innovation, creativity) as well as engaging in affordable emotional relationships with human users.

AB  - Quantum mechanics is a revolutionary scientific field, which lies at the crossroad section of Physics, Mathematics, Computer and Computational Science. In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games proposed in this paper relates to quantum strategic games, necessary for STEM activities to train students within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry-based learning using Python libraries.

AB  - Contribution: This paper employs the automatic scoring of short essays as a novel way to determine pre-service teachers' knowledge of and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) from their written reflections. Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.

AB  - This paper presents a simultaneous optimization method of a case-based reasoning (CBR) system using a genetic algorithm (GA) for product designing. Prior research proposed many hybrid models of CBR and the GA for product design. However, those models were not good at aiding at creative designing. In this study, CBR and GA combine with a algorithm process for simulation of directed similarity association according to human being's thought models. Experimental results show that the new hybrid model outperforms other conventional approaches for creative design.

AB  - This work in progress paper in the research-to-practice category focuses on high school students planning to enter a new learning environment for transition. Prospective students benefit from structured programming that considers two factors. First, the college knowledge required to navigate day-to-day logistics including new living arrangements, supporting physical & mental health, and funding the experience. Second, STEM curricula and challenges students from extremely rural communities face in identifying with these rigorous programs. The work of influential researchers in student transition and retention along with contextual findings from a large, rural state in the Rocky Mountain region informed the redesign of an engineering college's outreach program. This paper has two purposes. First, it details how established theories combined with research findings and assessment can create robust models to support keeping recruitment programs relevant. Second, it provides an example of how a model was developed and then used to redesign and assess an outreach program using college peer mentors to support high school-aged students interested in engineering and computing disciplines.

EA have been used in different musical applications, ranging from new systems for composition and performance, to models for studying musical evolution in artificial societies. This paper starts with a brief introduction to three main fields of application of EA in music, namely sound design, creativity and computational musicology. Then it presents our work in the field of computational musicology. Computational musicology is broadly defined as the study of music with computational modelling and simulation. We are interested in developing A-Life-based models to study the evolution of musical cognition in an artificial society of agents. In this paper we present the main components of a model that we are developing to study the evolution of musical ontogenies, focusing on the evolution of rhythms and emotional systems. The paper concludes by suggesting that A-Life and EA provide a powerful paradigm for computational musicology

The cyber security industry has disparate ways of recruiting its workforce owing to the prevailing educational system and diverse work roles in the field of cyber security. Comparison is drawn between the old and revised models of Bloom’s taxonomy to depict which model best represents the dynamic learning objectives and outcomes of cyber security education. A rubric is designed from the Dreyfus et al model of skill acquisition based on the iterations of Bloom’s taxonomy to assess cyber security competencies to achieve mastery. To bridge the skills gaps in the industry, Bloom’s taxonomy provides the impetus to align the needs of industry with educational programs [1].

AB  - RoblockLLy is an educational robotics simulator designed for primary and secondary school students, whose goal is to increase their interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In the particular case of computer science, it allows developing computational thinking skills. It has been designed with ease of use in mind. This free tool is available through a web browser and does not need a complex installation or specific hardware requirements, allowing educational robotics to be introduced to a wide range of users by working on practical projects that will help them understand key concepts of robotics and programming. The effectiveness of RoblockLLy has been validated based on motivation, usability, and user experience criteria. The tool was validated with 212 secondary school students (12–16 years old). Specifically, motivation was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, usability with the System Usability Scale, and user experience with the User Experience Questionnaire. Generally speaking, the results demonstrate that students perceived RoblockLLy as a novel and interesting tool. The ratings for usability were predominantly positive, although a few students indicated a preference for expert assistance. The overall rating of the user experience was positive as well, yet notable differences in attitudes toward motivation and usability were observed between genders.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Low-dose computed tomography (CT)screening has been shown to significantly reduce lung cancer mortality but suffers from a high false positive rate that leads to unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The development of deep learning techniques has the potential to help improve lung cancer screening technology. Here we present the algorithm, DeepScreener, which can predict a patient's cancer status from a volumetric lung CT scan. DeepScreener is based on our model of Spatial Pyramid Pooling, which ranked 16th of 1972 teams (top 1 percent)in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition (DSB2017), evaluated with the challenge datasets. Here we test the algorithm with an independent set of 1449 low-dose CT scans of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)cohort, and we find that DeepScreener has consistent performance of high accuracy. Furthermore, by combining Spatial Pyramid Pooling and 3D Convolution, it achieves an AUC of 0.892, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using only 3D convolution. The advancement of deep learning algorithms can potentially help improve lung cancer detection with low-dose CT scans.

AB  - This research category paper examines the impact of computational thinking within first-year engineering courses on student pathways into engineering. Computational thinking and programming appear in many introductory engineering courses. Prior work found that early computational thinking development is critical to the formation of engineers. This qualitative research paper extends the research by documenting how pre-university privileges impact first-year student trajectories into engineering through a qualitative examination of student interviews from three institutions with different processes for matriculation into engineering majors. We identify the underlying assumptions of meritocracy that are concealing the role of educational privilege in selecting which engineering students will be allowed to join the field. We provide a suggestion for how institutions can include computational thinking in introductory engineering courses with less risk of furthering the marginalization of students with few academic privileges.

AB  - Game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to enhance engagement, comprehension of course material, and academic achievements. This study aims to investigate previous studies on integrating computational thinking (CT) abilities in STEM education through GBL and propose a framework for integrating CT through the GBL framework. The proposed framework focuses on certain domains in creating mobile gaming content that facilitates the user's acquisition of knowledge about the advancement of CT in science, specifically within the STEM discipline. In addition, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to identify a specific research need. In the proposed framework, this study emphasized more that CT is implemented as an approach to attract the involvement of students in STEM education through the framework. To foster more engagement, the development of CT should consider STEM-appropriate components of the framework by optimizing software and hardware functions.

Utilizing Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), we examined interaction behaviors and cognitive development in a foundational computer science course. Data were collected from a Chinese university over nine weeks, involving two experimental phases. The analysis categorized students into core and peripheral groups based on centrality metrics, revealing significant differences in their engagement and learning levels. Core group members demonstrated higher cognitive development and problem-solving abilities, with dense connections in higher-order cognitive stages. In contrast, peripheral group members showed limited interaction and basic cognitive outcomes. The findings emphasize the critical role of collaboration and communication in fostering Deeper Learning, suggesting the need for educational institutions to adopt new teaching methods and technologies. By promoting high-order cognition and collaborative learning, educators can enhance students' critical thinking, innovation, and problem-solving skills, ultimately contributing to a dynamic and enriched learning environment.

AB  - This paper investigates how to increase understanding of design and sustainable systems by scaffolding cognitive access and transfer of learning using eclectic approaches to experiment with networks of design potentials. Cognitive access simulates multi-criteria case indexing, refined from knowledge induction derived from analyses of random but related cases based on search strategies. Randomization of the search space encourages emergence of heuristic solutions, fuzzy though informed transfers and further refinement of schema. We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning. Examples from two courses carried out August-December 2017 within the participatory design-agile framework for engagement in Smart Cities are assessed for creative reuse regarding: a) people, process and tools; b) domain engineering; c) component mining and d) open source vs. systematic reuse. Findings confirm longitudinal insights: CBR-informed but emergent search leading to more efficient and higher quality heuristic transfer and learning is scaffolded by systemic modelling and design dependent on four factors.

AB  - While preparing students for careers beyond graduation, HBCU faculty often have to balance the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness as influenced by industry and discipline standards. Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This paper explores the challenges experienced by an HBCU faculty member while integrating GitHub into an advanced programming class. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.

AB  - Creative thinking is one of the hallmarks of human-level competence. Although it is still a poorly understood subject speculative ideas about brain processes involved in creative thinking may be implemented in computational models. A review of different approaches to creativity, insight and intuition is presented. Two factors are essential for creativity: imagination and selection or filtering. Imagination should be constrained by experience, while filtering in the case of creative use of words may be based on semantic and phonological associations. Analysis of brain processes involved in invention of new words leads to practical algorithms that create many interesting and novel names associated with a set of keywords.

AB  - With the introduction of computer programming in schools around the world, a myriad of guides are being published to support educators who are teaching this subject, often for the first time. Most of these books offer a learning path based on the experience of the experts who author them. In this paper we propose and investigate an alternative way of determining the most suitable learning paths by analyzing projects developed by learners hosted in public repositories. Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests.

AB  - The Computational Thinking (CT) conceptual framework is entering its second decade of research yet still lacks a cohesive definition by which the field can coalesce. The lack of clear definition makes assessment tool challenging to formulate, pedagogical efforts difficult to compare, and research difficult to synthesize. This paper looks to operationalize differing definitions of CT enhancing the ability to teach then assess the presence of CT. Expanding upon CT definitions, industry practices and processes, and educational theory, we link existing concepts and propose a new element to model an active definition of CT as a theoretical framework to guide future research. Our model updates existing CT definition by formally including Modeling, introducing Socio-Technical processes, separating Information Gathering from Data Collection and adding emphasis to Testing as a vital CT concept. We feel these elements and interconnections make CT is easier to describe and measure.

AB  - This research-to-practice full paper deals with the difficulty that it is possible to teach computational thinking through the teaching of algorithms and programming to a person with ADD. We propose approaches to teach algorithms, knowing that it is a difficult task for many teachers. Likewise, inspiring the student's interest also has its difficulties. The Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) understands that it is fundamental and strategic for Brazil that computer content is taught in basic education. Considering the 4.0 education of a connected generation, the thinking of computer education is relevant to the construction of youth and adult education. When we include people with ADD, this challenge is not trivial. This work presents a case study carried out with a high school student who has ADD and the techniques that were used to teach him to program to maintain his interest in the area. The method used was divided into three stages: Computer Discovery (1); Introduction to computational thinking through programming (2); Learn by Doing, in line with real-world problem solving using pair programming technique and challenge-based learning strategy (3). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the developed strategies, an experimental case study was carried out with a student who has ADD. The student was introduced to the content and approaches for 34 weeks, totaling 204 hours. The student presented a strong indication of learning and will forever have the ability of computational thinking to program and develop their applications.

AB  - Computational thinking is considered an important skill set for 21st-century learners and became a subject of focus in K-12 education in recent years. It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. In this paper, we investigated what is the Greek Primary and Secondary School Teachers’ understanding and awareness as far as Computational Thinking is concerned. Since teachers are the agents of change, it is critical to find out how familiar and/or skilled they are with the Computational Thinking notion. Thus, we applied a qualitative questionnaire all over the whole Greek State where 406 teachers answered. The study led to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the teacher’s readiness, as well as more generic aspects according to their profile and faculty.

AB  - The educational challenges of society permeated by digital technologies are aimed at developing skills to identify and solve environment problems. In this context, computational thinking (CT) emerges as a set of skills to be developed from an early age, which requires the empowerment of programming and demands the use of technological tools. The purpose of this article is to present the design and implementation process of a computer tool for CT evaluation, as well as its validation with a sample of elementary school students from a public institution in Colombia. The methodology focuses on the phases of the SCRUM development process. The results show that women perceive less difficulty in understanding the activities to be solved. It is possible to obtain a web application type software taking into account the evaluated characteristics of the tools used for CT teaching, covering most of these, and with special emphasis on some such as the content in Spanish, instructional model, management of the course, learning activities, monitoring, feedback and gamification.

AB  - Contribution: A problem-solving approach (PSA) model derived from major computational thinking (CT) concepts. This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops. There was no significant difference significant difference for the pretest scores of all three workshops. The analysis of the posttest further confirmed that the experimental groups (PBL and GBL) exhibited significant difference in the scores compared to the control group. However, the posttest results did not differ significantly between the experimental groups (PBL and GBL).

In this study the authors looked at a similar scenario of human-environmental interaction using Internet-mediated simulations as learning environments. One hundred and forty-nine vocational high schools students participated in this study to see if they can develop adequate thinking style when they learned in a simulation environment with help from agents. The results show that the judicial thinking style was best suited to the system we designed for this project - that is, we observed the greatest amount of development for this particular thinking style. Our results indicate that it is possible to establish and support thinking styles via Internet-mediated simulations.

AB  - This paper investigates the long-established ecological cognition framework and updates it to better account for the advances in computational science computational intelligence. To do this, two concepts are explored. The first, ‘serendipity engineering for seductive hypermedia,’ looks at how to design information systems to account for the pleasant occurrences that happen in offline environments studied by those in sales and marketing where beneficial outcomes often occur by chance encounters. The second, ‘user analysis using socialnomics’ looks at how a parametric user model based on the ecological framework can be used to understand users of information systems from the point of view of supporting a digital economy of users. A number of additional equations are developed using socialnomics that can be applied to digital transformation based on the parametric user model, including to calculate probability of seduction and probability of serendipity in an information system. The parametric model presented has great applicability for information and communications technology solution providers.

AB  - Contribution: We present a framework for teachers to investigate the relationships between attributes of students’ solutions in the process of problem solving or computational thinking. We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.

AB  - Computational thinking ability is important in computer science education. It emphasizes abstraction and automation. For automation, programming has become a key ability in digital society recently. As a result, the increase in the importance of coding education in many countries has brought various educational methods to improve teenagers' programming abilities. Among programming abilities, reading ability is important especially to programming novices. This paper focuses on the effects of gender and abstract thinking abilities of adolescents on understanding computer programs. Also, we examine if there is any difference in teaching between adolescents and college students. In order to achieve our research goals, we surveyed on the abstract thinking level, and then measured program understanding ability for 300 academic high school students who had learned C language. From this research, we found that the abstract thinking affects more complex program understanding positively. Also, we found that the language experience before learning brought the difference in program understanding. However, we could not find statistical differences in program understanding between two genders. From this research, we can provide a new point of view to improve adolescents' programming ability with abstract thinking and gender factors.

AB  - In recent years, many initiatives have aimed to develop basic computational thinking skills. Despite the popularity of online platforms for early programmers, we still lack detailed information to analyze how these skills are acquired. In the present study we analyzed clickstream data from 3,355 participants enrolled in several Computational Thinking workshops using Kodetu, an online platform with fine grained logging features. Participants used Kodetu's coding blocks to solve challenges of increasing difficulty while we gathered their clickstream in the platform. Here, we present our findings after evaluating these data in regards of participants' characteristics (age, sex, previous knowledge), similarity with previously submitted solutions, and degree of discrepancy from the optimal solution. To facilitate collaboration with other researchers in this area, we released our dataset under an open license. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest Computational Thinking-related datasets publicly available.

AB  - Educational Robotics has proven a feasible way of supporting and exemplifying Computational Thinking. With this paper, we describe the user-centered iterative and incremental development of a new educational robotic system, BRICKO, to support tangible, social and playful interaction while educating children in 1st-3rd grade in Computational Thinking. We develop the system through seven main iterations including a total of 108 participant pupils and their teachers. The methodology is a mixture of observation and interviews using Wizard of OZ testing with the early pilot prototypes as well as usability and user experience testing with the following incrementally improved digital prototypes. Our results for development and evaluation are presented for each iteration leading onto the next and describes the evolution of both the BRICKO driving robot as well as the BRICKO programming-board and its different categories of command-bricks. We discuss the methodologies used for assuring a playful and social educational robotic system and conclude that we achieved a useful prototype for supporting education in Computational Thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking is an essential skill that allows humans to solve a complex problem that later on can be understood by computers and humans. Abstraction and automation are the core of computational thinking. Therefore, CT is the key skill in Industry 4.0. However, in Malaysia's manufacturing, only 50 percent of SMEs deploy automation. Automation can make the company more efficient, more accurate and decrease human error. CT was built based on 4 basic pillars which are abstraction, decomposition, algorithm and pattern recognition. These pillars will encourage automation, efficiency, and innovation. Moreover, one of the benefits of CT for nonprogrammer is the formulated problem can be passed on to information-processing agents such as third-party companies or freelancers who can create the solution. In this paper, we review the benefits of computational thinking in entrepreneurship in the context of Industry 4.0.

AB  - In the article, the authors propose technological projects to develop computational thinking following the four problem-solving phases: understanding the problem, making the plan, executing the plan, and reviewing the solution. This study was based on a quantitative approach; the participants were 37 engineering students who had just entered university; also, the Pearson correlation statistical test was used to assess the relationship between computational thinking and problem- resolve. The activities of the technological projects have been developed using technological resources, such as the Arduino board, the mBlock software, and electronic sensors. It has been shown that following the problem-solving method based on the four phases contributes to the development of computational thinking skills in engineering students who have recently entered university.

AB  - The Raspberry Pi platform provides true equal opportunity-of-use in computing globally. From it, new affordable research and industrial opportunities have emerged. To fully realise its driving potential, particularly in developing countries, a persistent knowledge teaching process for the Raspberry Pi is necessary. This paper presents a quasi-flipped learning model (QFLM) intended to spark critical and creative thinking and foster an entrepreneurial spirit early in a student's tertiary education life-cycle. The model was applied as part of a computer science component for third year students in the Electrical & Information Engineering (E.I.E) Department of the University of Nairobi. Student programming confidence and completion of a time-bound project were used as model assessment metrics. It was found that the Raspberry Pi, coupled with the learning model, is a viable catalyst for local innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities.

AB  - The optimal paradigm and systematic solution to scheduling and decision-making for container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) have been scarce owing to their high nolinear and complexity and the strong coupling and randomness. In this paper, the concept of computational logistics for CTLS is proposed above all, and then the instruction sets, resource constraints, and operating environments for CTLS abstract machines are defined on the basis of the similarities and differences between computer systems and CTLS. Subsequently, CTLS are discussed from the perspective of asymmetric single-ISA multi-core processors (AMP) in detail within the conceptual framework of computational logistics and generalized computing. Consequently, a container terminal computational logistics model is presented with computing architecture and central properties of AMP. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated and validated by investigating through capacity, task latency and load balancing of a typical container terminal logistics service case with a comprehensive scheduling algorithm that is a composite of multifarious classical decision thinking and algorithms.

In this article, we show how to use the Regulated Activation Network (RAN) cognitive model to reconstruct abstract concepts and their blends. The MNIST dataset is used in this work to build a representation of abstract concepts. For the demonstration, three experiments were designed: first, shows how a high dimensional input image is encoded into a low dimension vector and further reconstructed back into an image; second, reconstruction of blends of abstract concepts that represent same digits; third, reconstructing blends of abstract concepts which represent different digits. The reconstructed images in all three experiments were visually analyzed. The best reconstructions were observed with the encoded image experiment obtaining Mean Squared Error of 0.00562 and an Rsquare score of 0.9193. The blends of similar abstract concepts also reconstructed the expected blend of a digit. The blends of dissimilar abstract concepts reconstructed the images by creating interesting symbols such as character x.

AB  - This innovative practice paper describes a work in progress on creating and applying educational games that develop mathematical and computational thinking within the project Science&Math educational games from preschool to university - SciMaG. Using educational games, especially in STEM fields, is an effective way to engage students and promote key skills across different age groups and environments. Such activities promote problem solving, logical thinking, strategic planning, and other important skills and can be used with students of different age groups in the classroom, in extracurricular activities, or at home. STEM science outreach activities organized as part of science festivals and similar events can be an excellent opportunity for a game-based approach. However, organizing events for large numbers of participants can pose a logistical challenge in terms of volunteer availability. This paper presents the results of a study in which game-based activities to develop mathematical and computational thinking were integrated into a science outreach event for primary school students on the occasion of Pi-Day. The innovative aspect of the approach is reflected in the use of a combination of games (commercial, newly developed games, and games inspired by commercial ones) which have an interesting math basis and require mathematical or computational thinking skills as well as in the introduction of peer teaching through attracting high-school students as volunteers for the organized event. In the evaluation of the approach, the perceptions of the primary school students (Ns=295), their teachers (NT=19), and the high-school students participating as volunteers in the organized event (Nv=11) were examined using a questionnaire-based study. All groups of participants responded positively and confirmed educational potential of the games. Results confirmed that the activities were well-received and that such events have the potential to enhance learning experiences in STEM. The results also provide valuable insights and motivation for further development of educational games within the SciMaG project.

Ontology COKB-ONT (Computational Object Knowledge Base) is an ontology was researched and applied in designing knowledge base systems, such as domain of knowledge about analytic geometry, linear algebra. However, when dealing with a practical problem, we often do not immediately find a new solution, but we search related problems which have been solved before and then proposing an appropriate solution for the problem. In this paper, the extension model of ontology COKB-ONT has been presented. In this model, Sample Problems, which are related problems, will be used like the experience of human about practical problem, simulate the way of human thinking about finding solution of problem. This extension model is applied to construct a program for solving plane geometry problems in middle school.

AB  - The planning and scheduling of container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) are the multi-objective and multiple strong constraints combinatorial optimization challenges under the uncertain environments, and those are provided with high goal orientation, dynamics, context-sensitivity, coupling, timeliness, and complexity. The increasingly sophisticated decision-making for CTLS is one of the most pressing problems for the programming and optimization method available. This paper discusses CTLS in terms of logistics generalized computation complexity based on computational thinking, great principles of computing, and computational lens, which three are abbreviated with 3CTGPL, and makes a definition of container terminal oriented logistics generalized computational complexity (CTO-LGCC) and container terminal logistics generalized computation comprehensive performance perspective (CTL-GCCPP) from the dimensions of time, space, communication, processor, and memory access. Both can analyze, generalize, migrate, translate, localize, modificate, and evaluate the above-complicated problems and lay solid foundations and establish a feedback improvement framework for the computational model and scheduling algorithms of the CTLS, which is an essential complement to the modeling and optimization methodology and solutions to CTLS with computational logistics. Finally, aimed at the logistics service cases for a large-scale container terminal, the simulation is designed and implemented for different scheduling algorithms, and the qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis is executed for the concomitant CTO-LGCC that demonstrates and verifies the feasibility and credibility of the CTO-LGCC and CTL-GCCPP from the viewpoint of the practice of container terminal decision-making support on the tactical level.

AB  - This paper shows a program that performs creative inference, with "creative" and "inference" defined according to the philosophy of C. S. Peirce. The results of the program are other programs which cannot be predicted by the programmer of the first program but nevertheless correctly perform vaguely defined actions. Further research may find a way to apply these results in order to create an automated manner to deal with the intrinsic vagueness of natural language.

AB  - Computers cause an impact in almost every single aspect of our lives, however, unfortunately, schools have not been able to keep up with this irreversible evolution. The simple use of technological apparatuses in the classroom does not guarantee the improvement of the learning process, however it can be the medium through which the students find the alternatives for the solution of complex problems. The Computational Thinking is an approach of teaching that uses a diverse range of techniques derived from computers for the resolution of these problems combined with the new competencies of the 21st century (critical thinking, collaboration, etc.). The adoption of the notion of Computing within the basic education schools is a concern in many countries, where the implementation occurs in a strict way. Admittedly, it grows the idea that the Computing discipline is very distinct from the computer classes and that the use of skills from Computing possesses educational (reflection and problem solving, the comprehension that the world is ingrained with the digital technology) and economic (high demand of professionals with good training) benefits. This article, through the vast bibliographic review, describes an international landscape of countries of all Americas, in order to contextualize the reader in respect to the adoption of Computational Thinking within the basic education schools.

AB  - Summary form only given. Recent basic studies reveal that AI problems are deeply rooted in both the understanding of the natural intelligence and the adoption of suitable mathematical means for rigorously modeling the brain in machine understandable forms. Learning is a cognitive process of knowledge and behavior acquisition. Learning can be classified into five categories known as object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, behavior generation, and knowledge acquisition. A fundamental challenge to knowledge learning different from the deep and recurring neural network technologies has led to the emergence of the field of cognitive machine learning on the basis of recent breakthroughs in denotational mathematics and mathematical engineering. This keynote lecture presents latest advances in formal brain studies and cognitive systems for deep reasoning and deep learning. It is recognized that key technologies enabling cognitive robots mimicking the brain rely not only on deep learning, but also on deep reasoning and thinking towards machinable thoughts and cognitive knowledge bases built by a cognitive systems. A fundamental theory and novel technology for implementing deep thinking robots are demonstrated based on concept algebra, semantics algebra, and inference algebra.

AB  - Distinguishing between literal and metaphorical language is a major challenge facing natural language processing. Heuristically, metaphors can be divided into three general types in which type III metaphors are those involving an adjective-noun relationship (e.g. “dark humor”). This paper describes our approach for automatic identification of type III metaphors. We propose a new algorithm, the Concrete-Category Overlap (CCO) algorithm, that distinguishes between literal and metaphorical use of adjective-noun relationships and evaluate it on two data sets of adjective-noun phrases. Our results point to the superiority of the CCO algorithm to past and contemporary approaches in determining the presence and conceptual significance of metaphors, and provide a better understanding of the conditions under which each algorithm should be applied.

AB  - The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented rise in enrollments in online learning experiences among learners of all ages. In this article, we explore the impact of the global pandemic on a massive open online course, Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking, with a particular focus on the topics learners chose for their final projects. The Computational Thinking MOOC was designed using a project-based learning approach and aims to provide learners with an introduction to the “big ideas” of computational thinking using a range of case studies that encompass topics such as airport surveillance, epidemiology, and human trafficking. Beyond observing a sharp increase in enrollment and engagement at the time the pandemic began, we discuss ways in which the course's project-based pedagogy allowed learners to bring their present experiences and concerns together with the course's subject matter in order to meet the learning objectives for the course. Many learners chose to address aspects of the pandemic in the course's final project and applied ideas about computational thinking to peer-graded assignments that conveyed an individualized sense of importance and urgency. We assert that this approach, along with the inclusion of a timely epidemiology case study, enabled learners to more deeply internalize the role that computational thinking can play in their own lives and in society as a whole.

AB  - This study discusses a NSF-funded Research Practice Partnership (RPP) to develop and pilot instructional materials for teaching computational thinking to Grades 3-5 students, with a focus on language learners. The study takes place in a U.S. school district whose percentages of Latino/a students, language learners, and low-income students are among the highest in the nation. The project is among the first to examine the linguistic and sociocultural factors that facilitate the success of multilingual students in mastering computational thinking. Utilizing principles of Design-Based Implementation Research in alignment with the RPP approach, researchers worked collaboratively with teachers and administrators to identify problems of practice in computer science education specific to the district. A broad survey of national and regional computer science initiatives was conducted to identify effective approaches for teaching computational thinking to diverse learners. As a result of this survey, the RPP identified a pathbreaking curriculum that aligns with the Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 standards to pilot in five classrooms in the first year of the RPP. The curriculum was further revised to align with the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and the California English Language Development standards during a week-long summer institute. This paper describes these experiences, highlighting the integration of computational thinking into an English Language Arts curriculum as well as the linguistic scaffolding strategies utilized to better meet the needs of multilingual students. This experience report uncovers pedagogical practices of computational thinking for diverse students and identifies areas for future work.

AB  - Nowadays, the analysis of the relationship between students' ICT literacy and CT skills remains unclear, and less attention is paid to the influence of ICT resources at school on CT skills. To fill these gaps, a survey was performed on 1056 participants between the ages of 11 and 14, attending a secondary school in China. The participants completed one self-reported questionnaire about CT skills, ICT literacy, and ICT resources at school. The study revealed gender differences in CT skills based on the independent samples t-test, with boys having higher CT skills than girls. Additionally, the study found that ICT literacy mediates the relationship between ICT resources at school and CT skills. The research findings provide important insights for improving students' CT skills. Educators should pay attention to the gender differences in CT skills of male and female students and improve the acquired CT skills of female students. In addition, the improvement of students' ICT literacy skills and the improvement of ICT resources at school can also have a positive effect on students' CT skills.

AB  - This Research Full Paper addresses the definition and implementation of Computational Thinking (CT) in K-12 education. CT is the focus of ongoing debate about the future of computing in schools, and this poses a number of challenges. Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading. We conclude by summarising the implications these questions have for the future development of K-12 curricula and teaching practices.

AB  - Computational thinking, a problem solving method that uses computer science techniques, has recently become mainstream as many governments and major Internet companies are promoting programming skills among children. However, little is known about how programming affects other aspects of life beyond the acquired programming skills. In this regard, this paper summarizes the work done in the school San Diego and San Vicente (Madrid, Spain) during the third quarter of the year 2013/2014, where we conducted a study with four groups of students in 4th and 5th grade to measure to what extent the use of computer programming in English classes can be an interesting educational tool with a positive impact on the learning otucome of the students. The results show that the groups working with programming activities improved more than the groups using traditional resources. Moreover, when asked via surveys at the end of the study, most students felt that coding was a positive influence, not only for learning English, but for developing other important skills as teamwork and learning to learn.

AB  - Effective application of contextual learning can be facilitated by providing opportunity to students to use the knowledge in concept learnt, to solve certain problems within a `context'. To improve student engagement in quantitative based course like Math, Accounting or Science; it is of supreme importance that students are able to make connections between knowledge and its application to a real world context. Two such cases of Contextual Learning have been presented in this paper which was modeled in implementation of interdisciplinary projects across Accounting and IT disciplines, with Business students enrolled in Managerial Accounting and Cost Accounting courses and CIS students in Mobile Application course and ICT. This study aims at presenting a contextual strategy used to enhance Accounting and IT skills in Undergraduate students at Dubai Women's College, Higher Colleges of Technology. We posited that through this contextualized approach, students would see Accounting, Computational thinking and app development as tools for solving work-related problems. Using Constructivist teaching and REACT (relating, experience, application, collaboration and transfer) strategy; we initiated curriculum integration of both Accounting and IT, which deviates from traditional teaching model where learning of a subjects is isolated from any context. We conclude that the interdisciplinary projects implemented were a robust technique for application of contextual learning. The most important outcome was achieving the highest level in bloom's taxonomy and that is to `create'.

These are factors that limit the teaching of computing in the education of children. As a solution to this problem, the project called “SCRATCHTON” is created, which looks forward to bringing technology to children in an efficiently and easy way. This consists in a programming contest where kids develop a game based on a given theme, where participants need to complete the challenge with the help of Scratch tools that were previously taught through video tutorials. With this, the goal is to encourage children to have better analytical skills, to awake computational thinking, and to increase interest in programming through incentives and recognition.

With the development of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT shows excellent conversational and creative reasoning capabilities. However, we still know very little about the design ideation process and its performance in terms of productivity. In this paper, we propose a representation of the design ideation process based on NLP. On this basis, referring to LASSO and linkography method, we propose a DCLASSO model to calculate the interconnections between design moves in protocol analysis. In the subsequent experiment, we take the design protocols generated by ChatGPT as the experimental sample to verify the proposed model. Finally, with the generated linkographs, the characteristics of ChatGPT and human designers are analyzed and compared from aspects of design ideation process and design productivity.

One of the primary challenges is data that is being generated in huge quantity at enormous pace and in variety of forms. Social medium has blow up as a sort of online discussion where people create and share the information at a substantial rate. The outlook of social media user is now noticeably used for taking the decisions. Evaluating sentiments, opinions and emotions by a group of people in the form of reviews pertaining to a certain event can carve out the niche of providing insights into the review text analytics, especially when text data is large. On one hand sentiments shows the conformity, disparity or objectivity among the masses whereas on the other hand emotions coming out from text clusters the group feedback. In this paper, the authors analyses the sentiments of patients pertaining to ayurvedic spa treatment. User reviews from the top rated websites are extracted to obtain the sentiments. The authors explore the possible ways to analysis the user sentiments using NLTK and Python programming libraries.

This tool is very helpful for the user who doesn't have prior programming knowledge and they want to learn and apply the computational concepts as part of their design process. `Building-Blocks' is a graphical programming language used for generation of 3D structures using computational algorithms. This helps to create personally meaningful projects: designing a model, getting the physical object from a model, sharing ideas and project activities with others in Building-Blocks community.

AB  - We experimented with the viability of using Lego Mindstorms as an alternative approach to supplement the learning of Basic Programming among novice university students. The study captured reactions and responses from ten undergraduates who had no background in Programming and were facing difficulties coping with an introductory course in Programming. Four Lego Mindstorms units were deployed to examine the participants' problem-solving and computational thinking skills. Findings indicate a high positive response (t=3.88 and p =0.004 for Problem Solving; t=-4.13 and p=0.003 for Computational thinking) to the use of Mindstorms as a strategy to encourage higher-order thinking, a critical skill in learning Programming. Participants reported clarity in understanding computational thinking concepts and claimed to be better able to articulate problem-solving tasks when prompted using Mindstorms.

AB  - This poster proposal for the 2019 RESPECT Conference reports on the ongoing progress of the NSF-funded computer science pathways project entitled “Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways for the League of Innovative Schools” (award #1837386). Entitled “CT Pathways” for short, the three-year research practitioner partnership (RPP) is a collaboration between Digital Promise Global, Digital Promise, and the League of Innovative Schools, a national network of 101 school districts across 33 states, serving over 3 million students. The goal of CT Pathways is to design, investigate and improve inclusive computing pathways for all K-12 students, starting in elementary school and going through high school. In this RPP, researchers join with three “Core” districts and twelve “Pilot” districts from the League of Innovative Schools to focus on districts’ Hispanic and African American students, Title 1 schools and, more generally, their girls and low-income students. The poster presentation will focus on the first of CT Pathways’ three research questions: How do individual participating League districts define the purpose (“the why”) of CS and CT education, and how do these individual rationales subsequently inform respective district’s intention to offer their students more equitable access to CS/CT content (“the how”)? Results will be reported via baseline pre-survey results from district administrators as well as through follow-up interviews/discussions with select district leads. At this early stage, the primary goal is to help districts align the economic and digital literacy rationales for CS/CT education with the wider social justice and broadening participation considerations they have identified.

AB  - Machine learning is a key technology to design and develop products, systems, and even services. In particular, image classification using deep learning has been successfully applied to many fields. Although industrial designers might learn this is an opportunity for their best practice, studies demonstrating how to integrate the technology into the design process are rare. Thus, we discussed the need to introduce ML to industrial design by presenting examples and ML tools with lower scientific thresholds such as Weka that is preferable for industrial design students and practitioners. A five-stage process of applying ML to product form-giving is presented to illustrate the bridging of ML to the design process. Further technical details and industry case studies are needed to demonstrate evidence of the advantages of ML in form-giving. The implication is not only in sharpening the tools of product form-giving but also in rethinking the theories of industrial design.

AB  - This paper presents measure-valued Markov decision processes (MVMDPs) and gives an algorithm of finding an optimal policy for this model. MVMDP is a generalization of partially observable Markov decision process, and reflects an important characteristic of human thought: that people, under the possibility that they grasp the whole states (i.e., appropriately measure the state space), think of problems and can choose their own optimal actions. So the measure-valued Markov decision process is the conscious result of unconscious decision minds. Moreover, we extend this thought to the category of divergent thinking and presents measure-valued Markov process model which is based on the measure-valued branching process in modern probability theory. This model can depict the unconscious mind feature that is: the way of human thinking is not linear, like logical mind; on the contrary, the mind has a grasp of the whole problem and evolves in an “area” manner; in this way, the mind can always get the heart of problems. We believe this work is helpful for further development of artificial intelligence.

AB  - This paper summarizes the successes and challenges encountered during the incorporation of the New Mexico State University DISSECT (DIScovering SciEnce through Computational Thinking) Fellowship program into a 6th grade classroom. Graduate student fellows work with experienced K-12 teachers to create and deploy interactive computational thinking (CT) modules in middle and high school classrooms that promote active learning through the use of technology and cutting edge scientific research. One of the main objectives of the DISSECT program is to facilitate the professional development of graduate students in computing-rich fields, such as engineering, computer science, and biology, through leadership development, public speaking experience, and an enhanced vision of how CT is vital to in all scientific disciplines. The alliances formed between K-12 teachers and their fellows provide an opportunity for teachers to attain knowledge of CT principles and equips them with the ability to develop and continue their own future lesson plans integrating CT. This paper thoroughly describes specific modules that integrate CT concepts into the traditional 6th grade science curriculum, the statistical results of assessments gauging the development of CT skills and knowledge during the course of one academic year, and suggestions for improvements and incorporation into other curricula.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) has been identified in the last few years as a fundamental skill that should be developed by all people. This has motivated multiple initiatives, whether governmental, through organizations, or by individuals. However, upon realizing a literature review, to the best of our knowledge no initiatives that include minority groups such as those within the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were proposed. Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public. Furthermore, a posttest was executed 5 months later, with the objective of determining if the developed skills had been maintained over time. The results evidenced that the skills were in fact maintained in a sustained manner, demonstrating promising results.

AB  - Computational Thinking is a competence that is developed more in the last few years. This is due to the multitude of benefits it has in the classroom. Throughout this article we show a series of activities that promote the development of Computational Thinking using tools that allow visual block programming. The particularity of these activities is that some of them were performed during the confinement due to the COVID-19 and other activities were performed later, in the period known as the new normality. Throughout the article, details are provided about the different sessions. The different visual programming tools by blocks and the educational scenarios used are also indicated. In addition, the results obtained are shown.

The tool is a Visual Programming Language; the algorithms are formed by block-assembly, thereby solving one of the students' main problems, which are "syntax errors". In addition, the tool brings with it a set of level-ordered challenges aimed at teaching students basic principles of programming and logic (sequential programming, repetitive and conditional control structure), where at each level the student will learn the different concepts and behaviors of computational thinking. For the evaluations with the users we counted on the participation of 18 students between 12 and 15 years old coming from two public institutions of Rio de Janeiro. In these evaluations it was also considered to measure the sensation of immersion through Telepresence, Social Presence and Usability.

AB  - This research to practice, work in progress paper presents the analysis strategy used to assess the learning behavior using logs on an e-learning platform. Students who can link algebraic functions to their corresponding graphs perform well in STEM courses. Early algebra curricula teaches these concepts in tandem. However, it is challenging to assess whether students are linking the concepts. Video analyses, interviews and other traditional methods that aim to quantify how students link the concepts taught in school require precious classroom and teacher time. We use web logs to infer learning. Web logs are widely available and amenable to data science. Our approach partitions the web interface into components related to data and graph concepts. We collect click and mouse movement data as users interact with these components. We used statistical and data mining techniques to model their learning behavior. We built our models to assess learning behavior for a workshop presented in Summer 2016. Students in the workshop were middle-school math teachers planning to use this curriculum in their own classrooms. We used our models to assess participation levels, a prerequisite indicator for learning. Our models aligned with ground-truth traditional methods for 17 of 18 students. The results of the models with respect to the two types of components of the web portal have been used to infer possible data or graph oriented cognitive bias.

AB  - Whereas the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) shows limited global search ability and be liable to be trapped into local optimum, a double-assimilation of prosperity and destruction oriented improved imperialist competitive algorithm (DPDO-IIC A) is proposed tentatively to overcome inherent defects. The imperialist assimilation and colonial reform strategy are customized purposefully, and a novel population redistribution mechanism is introduced as well. The three improvement measures are supposed to further promote population diversity and searching accuracy. The CEC2017 test set is selected to verify the performance of the DPDO-IICA by the different types of numerical function problems with the different dimensions. Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity. In conclusion, the DPDO-IICA can effectively improve the ability of global exploration and avoid premature convergence in comparison with the original ICA.

AB  - Among diagrammatic representations, law encoding diagrams (LEDs) are a special class. A LED captures the important laws or relations of a domain in the structure of a diagram using geometrical, spatial and topological constraints, such that a single instantiation of a diagram represents one instance of a phenomenon. Research on LEDs uses a combination of approaches, including the analysis of properties, computational modelling and empirical studies. The overarching theoretical context of this work is the paradigm of complex information processing, which sees problem solving as symbol processing by the means of heuristic searching. This paper considers how different LEDs can be used to solve diverse problems, and contrasts them to common Cartesian graphs, to argue that LEDs may be useful representations for expert problem solving. LEDs seem to be able to support some of the abilities that experts appear to possess, such as: being able to perceive large meaningful patterns; solving problems fast and with little error; seeing problems at a deep level; and doing large amounts of qualitative analysis of problems. Various forms of problem solving are examined in a particular domain, using different LEDs and conventional graphs. One LED and some sample problems are described. The domain is that of collisions among bodies moving in a straight line, with no frictional resistance.

AB  - Existing scheduling and decision solutions to container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) are falling short of peoples' wishes both in theory and in practice. This paper proposes a container terminal gang scheduling computational paradigm (GSCP) for planning and control at container terminals based on computational thinking. GSCP is built on the computing perspective and architecture of multi-processor system-on-chip. GSCP applies principles of pervasive computing to evaluate load conditions of core resources, and then integrates the fundamental principles of gang scheduling, processor affinity and load balancing to define the flexible and robust decision framework and scheduling algorithm set. Those are intended to improve the performance of CTLS, and strive for balance among through capacity for vessels and containers, task latency and load leveling as well. GSCP is demonstrated and validated by a typical container hub logistics service case with intensive computational experiments.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has become an indispensable skill in the 21st century and has permeated into K-12 education at all levels. The evaluation of CT has become a crucial concern for educators and researchers. Currently., while extensive research has investigated the assessment of students' CT conceptual understanding., the measurement of their thinking processes is less involved. The game-based assessment appears to address this issue by analyzing students' behaviors and reactions during the gameplay process., which has become an emerging assessment tool in CT education. This drives the need for a comprehensive overview of this field. To fill this gap., this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review on the assessment of CT through games. It explores CT skills assessed through games., focusing on target groups, game forms., and benefits. A total of fifteen studies were examined. Findings indicate that algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, pattern recognition., and abstraction were commonly assessed in games. Different ways for assessing CT skills in games were identified, involving progression level, log data, and manual coding. The benefits of CT game-based assessments were broadly reported, such as enjoyable experiences for students, instant feedback, easy administration for teachers and researchers, and richer information on students' cognitive processes. However, limited has been done in exploring the use of digital games for younger age groups, and the psychometric qualities of the tools were hardly reported in the reviewed studies. The study sheds light on the research and teaching practices in using games and interactive assessment platforms in CT education.

In particular, a distinction is made between general problem solving processes and those relating to various types of specific problems. The role of knowledge, motivation, disposition and metacognitive style played in problem solving is also to be discussed. We interpret problem solving as a complex method in which creative and critical thinking play determinative roles. We would like to underline the significance of heuristic and algorithmic approaches in thinking-development from the point of view of the concrete engineering problem

AB  - The popularization of digital educational devices with low barriers to entry has encouraged the development of many training activities oriented towards the incorporation of technology in schools. In some cases, the introduction of technology has led to the development of new educational practices that support the development of computational thinking. However, the supposed benefits of these approaches have not been properly assessed. Moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the Scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. This study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like Scratch. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of Scratch programming achieved by the students of the School of Education of Vitoria-Gasteiz and their engagement with Scratch. We also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in Scratch workshops with us. After this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. Since we consider Scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status.

AB  - Occasionally, there may be a low impact on learning engagement between teachers and students due to, for example, poor internet connection or simply because students have lost their focus. One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach.

This paper presents a design thinking process model that records not only the design activities and decisions but also the design intents behind them. Based on this model, two types of inconsistency in design thinking process are identified. The implementation of consistency check and maintenance is based on assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS).

This paper presents a denotational mathematical structure and methodology for modeling fuzzy qualifications and quantifications in cognitive informatics, soft computing, and computational intelligence. Fuzzy qualifications and quantifications for both absolute and relative measures are formally elaborated on discrete and continuous fuzzy object and expressions. In addition, the qualification for characteristic attributes of fuzzy objects is modeled. Applications of fuzzy qualifications and quantifications are illustrated using a rich set of examples and real-world cases, which enable machines to mimic complex human reasoning mechanisms in cognitive informatics, soft computing, and computational intelligence.

One goal of higher education is to develop students' critical thinking and research skills. Prior work suggests these skills are best taught explicitly, when they are embedded in the curriculum, using active learning strategies, and using recent high-quality research as a basis for inquiry. Using multiple methods, this paper examines how teaching critical academic literacy skills through active learning strategies impacts student critical thinking ability and engagement. Results suggest substantial student engagement and improvements in critical literacy skills.

AB  - This work-in-progress paper is part of a project that aims to analyze how the implementation of different instructional designs through complete and incomplete examples influence the cognitive load that students perceive when learning statistics and computer programming. For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.

AB  - This article develops an instruction method for promoting design innovation capability through a design-based program with identification, modeling, simulation, and prototyping (IMSP). The computational thinking and conceptualization of sustainability were incorporated. The interaction between instruction treatment and participants' personality was investigated. Eighty-six engineering undergraduates participated in this experimental study for exploring the effectiveness of the IMSP program. The findings indicate that 1) the IMSP program promoted undergraduates' computational thinking, and further enhanced their design innovation ability; 2) the program that integrated the conceptualization of sustainability has better teaching effects than that without the conceptual integration; 3) the personal characters of innovation proaction and emotional intelligence acted as moderators in the ISMP program. This study presents a practical method for improving design innovation capability, and supports the feasibility and necessity of emphasizing computational thinking and sustainability in the innovation training program for engineering education.

AB  - The growing interest of educational researchers in computational thinking (CT) has led to an expanding literature on assessments of CT skills and attitudes. However, few studies have examined whether CT attitudes influence CT skills. The present study examines the relationship between CT attitudes and CT skills for preservice teachers (PSTs). The Callysto CT test (CCTt) for Teachers was administered to  $n\,\,=$  105 PSTs to measure their CT attitudes and skills. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship of participants’ CT and problem-solving skills with their attitudes toward CT, technology, coding, and data. Findings revealed that CT attitudes predicted CT skills and provided the first step in exploring the validity and reliability of the CCTt instrument.

Computer science already has a number of useful clearly defined models of computation whose behaviors and capabilities are well understood. We should use such models as part of any definition of the term computation. However, for new domains of investigation where there are no appropriate models it may be necessary to invent new formalisms to represent the systems under study.

AB  - Programming is one of the key assets in the modern society. In addition to teaching programming to future programmers, it has become more and more important to teach it alongside computational thinking to all students. We designed and implemented a programming course aimed for teacher students at our university. The goal of the course was to teach programming, computational thinking and the methods and tools used in programming education. The course was divided into two parts: first, the students were taught basic programming skills by utilizing tutorial-based learning with automatically assessed electronic exercises and play-based programming tasks. In the second part, the students utilized the acquired skills by teaching programming integrated into mathematics to children at elementary school level. The students worked really hard throughout the course, completing more than 90 % of all tasks in average. Moreover, the feedback from the tutorial sessions and the practice lessons at schools was mainly positive.

The course introduces the “concepts” and core “processes” of Computational Thinking using a visual programming environment. The design of the course PC-01 includes a set of multimedia content, learning tools and technologies that help teachers and students in the teaching-learning process. These tools allow the teacher the successful delivery of the course content as well as the individual/collective monitoring of students' progress in the course. Students have access to their progress throughout the course and participate in creative and collaborative tasks. This course also serves to introduce transversely educational technologies to many students of primary and secondary education. The technological environment integrates the online teaching resources and the methodological tools of the course. The course uses Scratch 2.0 as the programming environment and Moodle as the learning platform. At present the course is being implemented in public schools in the Dominican Republic.

AB  - The need to attract learners and improve retention in computational thinking classes has never been greater than presently. Alarmingly, research suggests that the relative popularity of computer science in K-12 and colleges is not increasing while other STEM subjects are witnessing substantial rise in enrollment. Moreover, more than one third of those who choose computer science, drop out or fail the first programming class dashing hopes of building a computationally savvy workforce for the emerging global economy. In this paper, we introduce a novel social networking system, called OpenSchool, for learners and educators alike, which is able to double as a contemporary social networking system along the lines of Facebook for instance, and serve the special needs of free-choice STEM learners, computer science learners in particular. We discuss its salient features, highlight its advantages, collaborating capabilities, and learning support for STEM, especially computational thinking, learners.

AB  - With the increased focus on Computational Thinking (CT) in education, there has been an increase in the development of learning platforms to teach CT. The current study developed an Online Inquiry-based learning platform for Computational Thinking (CT-ONLINQ) to support CT activities using Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) pedagogy. IBL-based CT steps include algorithm design, analysis, and comparison of algorithms. The platform allows students to explore multiple solutions and provides hints as support during problem-solving activities. A 4-week experimental study was conducted to evaluate the usability of the online platform. A total of 79 9th-grade students volunteered to participate in this study to complete six activities. Subsequently, the students completed the SUS questionnaire and open-ended feedback questions. Results showed that around 80% of the students scored above the “Good” category (70-80), with a total average score of 78.45. Also, we analyzed the difference in rating scores among groups based on multiple background factors. Findings showed an average rating above 4 with no significant difference between the ratings among factors such as gender and math performance (below-above average math scores). In addition, analysis of the feedback comments showed that the platform is user-friendly, with students enthusiastic about learning coding on the platform.

AB  - The computer science industry suffers from a significant gender gap. This situation likely hinders the creation of inclusive and user-friendly systems due to a bias in perspectives. To narrow this gender gap, this study investigates how females program to increase interest in computer sciences. Specifically, 60 open Scratch projects on the web are analyzed to clarify differences in the Computational Thinking scores with respect to gender. The difference in the Computational Thinking score by gender suggests that the gap may be due to the lack of the Synchronization element in female users’ projects. A deeper understanding of how people program based on gender should support creating an effective and inclusive learning environment and allow educators to create programming materials that attract both genders equally into the field.

AB  - Programming education is a crucial part of school education and an important way to effectively enhance learners' learning abilities. However, current programming education in secondary schools is not as effective as it could be in concrete implementation. Project-based learning is a possible path for programming education, but it is still difficult to achieve the goal of cultivating innovative talents by project-based learning alone. Therefore, in this paper, we integrate design thinking into project-based learning, firstly, we analyze the connotation of design thinking and explain the necessity of integrating design thinking into project-based learning; secondly, we construct a new model and practice process framework of secondary school programming PBL teaching integrating design thinking based on the general process of project-based learning and the basic model of design thinking, and explain the connotation. Finally, a case study of “Python programming” in the new version of high school IT textbook is conducted to provide reference for the practice of secondary school programming education.

AB  - In the context of Computer Science (CS) education, one of the most important goals is the development of computational thinking (CT) and problem solving skills. Computational thinking skills are closely related to the CS concepts and approaches. These skills cover fundamental programming concepts such as task decomposition, abstractions and generalization, data structures and algorithms. On the other hand, CS education challenges, promote the search for new educational tools, methods, activities and resources. Consequently, CS education should be extended by adding the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) paradigm principles. The aim of this paper is to show how STEM-driven CS education supports and ensures the development of computational thinking at the high school. We present the already published STEM-driven CS education approach aiming at extending it by introducing a model to assess student achievements, according to the revised Bloom's taxonomy in the connection with CT skills. As a practical implementation, we describe a curriculum of Programming Basics at the high school with respect to STEM-driven aspects and CT skills. We introduce two case studies implemented in the real educational environment. They provide the evidence of availability of our approach.

AB  - Scratch is a programming environment, which is widely adopted as the first language to enter the programming world. Since Scratch projects are rich in multimedia resources, it can be time-consuming to judge them by hand, requiring manual execution with the understanding of each project. Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners’ projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity. Through the correlation analysis between DWES CT scores and experts’ ratings, we find that compared with Dr. Scratch, the correlation coefficient has increased.

AB  - The assessment of computational thinking (CT) skills based on text-based programming is a necessary part of the implementation of CT education in higher education. However, the current research on CT assessment is mostly single-approach, which is not effective in accurately measuring numerous competencies of CT skills and has the disadvantage of assessment limitation. In order to solve the problem of assessment limitations, this paper defines the content of CT evaluation from the perspective of text-based programming and constructs a multidimensional test method. Different test schemes are selected according to the characteristics of CT skills, and assessment tools are developed by combining the question test, programming test and scale survey, and the assessment tools are used to evaluate and analyze learners' CT skills from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The results show that the evaluation indicators and test questions designed on text-based programming are more consistent with the evaluation objectives. And the approach of evaluating CT skills from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives can reflect learners' CT skills more comprehensively and accurately.

Embedding these skills in the K-12 and University curricula is necessary for training the next generation of thinkers. A widely adopted approach to doing so is through simple and visual programming languages like Scratch and engaging assignments like video-game construction. In this work, we report on an empirical study we conducted with senior undergraduate education students aiming to understand how prior experience enables students to better develop their computation-thinking skills through a Scratch-based video-game assignment.

AB  - While computational thinking (CT) has been identified as one of the fundamental 21st century skills that can be applied to different domains, school students usually show negative attitude toward learning CT. Educational games have been applied by several researchers to address related issues faced for promoting CT. Even though such games have shown some success in promoting CT, they fall short when it comes to acquisition of CT skills (they rather promote abstract and conceptual knowledge) and offering adaptivity to each player. To address these issues and improve the existing games, we developed an adaptive game called AutoThinking for teaching both CT concepts and skills, engaging students with individually tailored gameplay and learning. We conducted a qualitative study aimed at understanding the cognitive and affective experiences of Estonian primary school children. The findings showed that AutoThinking is making children feel challenged, happy, and confident, while activating their thinking process during the gameplay. All children perceived the game positively and found it to be a good tool for learning.

AB  - In contrast to the field of computer-supported or computer-assisted language learning (CALL), which has been investigated intensively for the last decades since the beginning of e-learning and technology-enhanced learning, computational thinking and computer science concepts are not quite common in the context of language lessons. Computational thinking is a problem solving process that, at first sight, has not much to do with language learning. However, as demanded by Jeannette Wing in 2006, it should be taught to everyone like reading, writing and mathematics. By introducing computational thinking in language lessons e.g. through modeling we could "kill two birds with one stone": On the one hand, we can teach computational thinking and basics of computer science at all school levels even if there is no related subject, e.g. in primary schools. On the other hand, computational thinking tools like modeling can support language learning in different ways and help to train text comprehension, to acquire and elaborate vocabulary or to visualize grammar rules etc. This paper describes some creative possibilities of introducing computational thinking through modeling in language lessons in primary and secondary education. Besides best practices, it further presents some experiences and results gained from teacher observation, interviews and informal feedback from students and teachers.

AB  - Many undergraduate students in software engineering have trouble developing computational thinking. Several tools have been reported in the literature to support the development of computational thinking. This paper reports a Systematic Literature Review to present the characteristics that have made successful web systems that support the development of computational thinking in recent years and the reported limitations. Eighteen primary studies were selected where the strategies used are usually learning through lessons, practicing with exercises, working through games, and using feedback. The systems found have been used at different elementary, middle, high school, and bachelor's degree levels. Finally, the main limitations reported in using these systems were mainly the difficulty of the topics, the previous knowledge that the students should have, the attitude that the students showed and the lack of motivation. Finally, we make some recommendations to software engineering curriculum planners and programming teachers about systems for developing computational thinking.

Computational thinking has been increasingly encouraged, not only for those who wish to become computer scientists, but also to develop other important skills that are used to solve problems, using a combination of critical thinking and fundamentals of computing. The research used was qualitative of the phenomenological type. In the analysis, the teachers involved concluded that to solve a problem, even if it is Ecology, it is not necessary to use a computer to process the algorithm to find the solution, a student can create an algorithm and process it and find the answer.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a key component of computer science and a foundational thinking process in K-12 classrooms. CT can be easily integrated into science lessons with the right policies, programs, and practices in place. This paper explores the current practices of CT in a northeast US state based on survey data collected from teachers. The research uncovers how much teaching time is spent teaching science and the percentage of lessons that have CT concepts and approaches present in the science instruction while describing what these lessons look like. This paper then discusses the next steps for implementation efforts based on the described CT practices in elementary science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) does not require profound knowledge of computer science (CS). Vice versa, it helps students organize and build up new knowledge around the core CS concepts they encounter on the daily basis. Furthermore, CT provides a set of problem-solving skills and enhances analytical abilities that are crucial for the young generation to succeed in modern world pervaded with technology. Teaching the principles of computing to students with non-computing tracks of study provides them with a competitive advantage and breaks down stereotypes around CS. Our approach is to introduce a topic related to world issues and students' interests while concealing its relation to CS until students' interest and attention are captured. The approach takes advantage of pattern-matching abilities that are naturally wired in our brain to improve understanding and make the obtained knowledge persist in memory. The paper discusses some of the modules developed as part of the Inspire-CT project that can be delivered in one or part of a class period at high school or middle school.

Game-Based Learning and Collaborative Learning are two approaches that may aid in the development of CT skills. This paper describes a framework based on Game and Collaborative Learning which aims to enhance the CT teaching that improves students' social skills in a fun way. The framework stands out by including collaborative learning features defined in the main literature. Also, the strategy was developed specifically to fit the games' dynamics. The approach was evaluated via metacognitive and transactive analysis and by a survey. The results showed evidence that the method is able to stimulate interaction among students to apply problem-solving strategies.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), one of the necessary and fundamental skills for students in the 21st century, is gaining more attention in K-12. The premise of integrating CT with other subjects is to promote school teachers with high self-efficacy in CT. Towards this, we developed a three-week Scratch online professional development(PD) course based on MIT CT framework, then implemented an online training among 84 primary and secondary school teachers from different subjects including Chinese, Mathematics, English, and Computer Science. To examine the effect of its impact on teachers' self-efficacy in CT, a quasi-experiment method of a single group pretest-posttest was conducted, and quantitative and qualitative data were collected from scales, artifacts, and interviews. The results revealed that the online PD course significantly improved teaching self-efficacy in CT of these teachers. The findings indicated that online PD integrated with MIT CT framework through block-based programming was a potential approach to effectively promote teaching self-efficacy in CT for primary and secondary school teachers.

The survey results showed that T{h}inker provides an engaging way to learn computational thinking and programming; has the potential to offer a variety of project opportunities; is easier to tinker with and (upon little practice) can provide appropriate difficulty level for entry-level undergraduate students while implementing the project ideas. This engaging potential of T{h}inker can be attributed primarily to the exploratory design and problem solving style it promoted in the laboratory against few predefined ways of problem solving expected in typical programming laboratory sessions.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) has been described as the use of abstraction, automation and analysis skills for problem solving, thus becoming a set of fundamental skills for the 21st century. Many initiatives have emerged to promote early development of CT skills. However, to date, there are no studies in which CT is developed in minority groups, such as individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a Game Design Workshop aimed at teenagers with Autism Spectrum Disorders. An analysis of the artifacts produced by the participants of a pilot offering of the workshop was performed using a rubric for CT skills acquisition. The results showed that the participants, all of them with high-functioning autism and no previous experience with programming, acquired intermediate level skills related to CT.

Using robotics as an example of CT instruction, I propose to examine a high school that has had a large number of robotics students over the past six years to find evidence for the long-term benefits of CT. I will analyze school records (e.g. STEM class enrollment, STEM test scores, SAT scores) for differences between robotics and non-robotics students and compare interviews with selected students.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience of positive outcomes with increased motivation and retention in teaching an introductory Computer Science course with Python programming. Without reinventing the wheel, we infused few well established pedagogies by integrating and evaluating Computational Thinking (CT) skills in a meaningful way. We integrated CT with existing curriculum alongside programming and teaching general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or languages at the beginning. Our aim here is not only to teach a programming language per se, but also to teach, at the beginning, the different ways of problem solving, logical reasoning, algorithm design, and programming constructs with minimal or no emphasis on syntax. A positive learning experience is successfully developed for our students by using appropriate pedagogies and strategies. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey as well as a pre- and post-CT test were conducted on student cohort in different sections. The statistical analysis of the survey and test results show evidence of improvement in student's problem solving and coding skills as well as increase in motivation towards programming.

AB  - Various didactic strategies to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills have been successful in terms of student engagement and educational outcomes. However, monitoring the learning progress of students is still a hurdle to teachers and researchers. In this context, we explore the use of self-organizing maps for analyzing games produced in a game building workshop offered simultaneously to technical education students in Brazil and to undergraduate students in Computer Engineering in Chile. Metrics from seven CT features present in the games were extracted with the Dr. Scratch tool and used as an input in the training process. The results allowed a clustering analysis considering the identified features and the correlation between learning behaviors. The organization of the map reflected a progressive skill acquisition identified by features present in the developed games. Also, it could be identified that students of both educational levels reached similar levels of CT skill development.

AB  - Broadening participation and increasing equity in computer science (CS) have been goals of the computing field for decades. Initiatives seeking to increase access to CS have led to an increase in elementary schools teaching computational thinking (CT), but students are often instructed by classroom teachers who have no formal training in CT or CS. Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS. Our findings suggest teachers would benefit from explicit support to provide opportunities for students currently underrepresented in CS and to offer more equitable opportunities to students regardless of their CS background.

AB  - As Computational Thinking (CT) becomes an increasingly necessary skill, it is crucial to examine how CT can be taught in the classroom. Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) is a practical concept to examine how CT education can be developed. This systematic literature review presents the discussion of K-8 teachers’ PCK in the implementation of CT- related activities in the classroom. Studies were extracted from Google Scholar’s database. Among these studies, 14 articles were deemed to be relevant for a more in-depth examination. Findings from this preliminary literature review suggest that teachers have clear purposes and goals for teaching CT and various instructional strategies for teaching CT. However, the existing studies lacked information about teachers’ knowledge and beliefs regarding the methods for assessing students’ CT. Practical implications and future directions to enhance K-8 teachers’ PCK on CT are discussed in this study.

AB  - This study reports a pre-college initiative that aims to integrate computational thinking (CT) in an integrated STEM learning environment in community centers' after-school programs for upper-level elementary school students. The initiative takes a collaborative approach that engages a range of stakeholders including higher institution's STEM educational researchers and disciplinary experts, a school district, three community centers and their satellite campus that serve Title I schools, and both in-service and pre-service teachers to develop and implement an integrated “STEM + CT” curriculum. The design and development of the integrated STEM+CT curriculum was guided by project-based learning (PBL) that engages students in sustained project-based activities and requires students to apply multiple STEM content knowledge and skills to solve a problem, in after-school programs where they enjoy large blocks of dedicated time to learn and practice CT and STEM. The implementation of the curriculum was led by in-service teachers in community centers' after-school programs who serve as facilitators and learners, and bring a depth of pedagogical knowledge, and who also benefit from such sustained interactions. This collaborative initiative brings relevant stakeholders together and helps build a researcher-practitioner partnership that aims to design, study, improve, and scale innovations in teaching and learning, which facilities the solving of a shared challenge of educational practice - how to integrate CT in K-12 STEM learning? - in this study. Lessons learned from the collaborative process are also discussed.

AB  - The concern on promoting the development of Computational Thinking (CT) in children has increased over the years. Games are recognized as a good strategy for presenting CT and for engaging children to the learning of its concepts. Hand gestures are a form of interaction widely used in video-games. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate how children feel and interact when using hand gestures in the context of learning tools. And this number decrease in studies about CT learning. In this paper, we explore the feedback of 29 children about their interaction by using hand gestures in a game to stimulate the CT which we called CT game. We also compare this type of interaction to touch. Additionally, we examine how both, hand gestures and touch, can impact on accomplishing of the goals of the game phases. Our findings revealed the children kept more engaged when using hand gestures, and consequently, this affected their concentration on the game purpose.

AB  - This document describes the development of a STEM course intended to improve the Computational Thinking of university students (CT). The main instructional tool for this course is the BEAM robot, a robotics paradigm that proposes simple robots whose behavior can be controlled without software programming. The programming of this robot is implicit in its morphology, so its actions and goals are codified from its construction. A three-phase curriculum is designed to achieve the objective: propaedeutic, robot assembly, and CT. On the basis of these phases, the course is constructed modularly and implemented virtually, while students receive construction kits. Each phase aims to foster the many facets of CT, such as decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, debugging, iteration, and generalization. Students’ responses to pre-and post-course surveys, as well as evaluation activities and logs, are analyzed to determine the course’s impact on them. In addition to other STEM disciplines (electrical, electronic, mechanical, and WEEE), the course substantially improves the CT.

AB  - Game-based learning (GBL) is a popular innovative pedagogical framework for developing Computational Thinking (CT) skills. The base idea is to use games to help create awareness and generated needed CT skills and abilities; in short, it is “games for CT” approach. This is however, one part of the equation for understanding and developing CT in our modern digital age. The other part of the equation lies in using “CT for games”. This paper addresses this perspective to aid in the understanding and framing of the elusive CT concept. In “CT for games”, this paper highlights and draws attention to using CT for developing games instead of using games to develop CT. The core contributions of the paper are a “CT for games” proposed framework; selected variants of health games and observations of “Rebel Design”. Readers can benefit from a perspective with a different focus and increase awareness and understanding of CT with the hope of grooming future leaders with required CT problem-solving skills and abilities and applying “Rebel Design” for games.

AB  - Pair programming (PP) is an effective and operable approach to improve Computational Thinking (CT). However, the process of PP is complex to understand for students at the elementary level, which needs to be supported. Collaboration scripts is a promising way to structure the collaborative process through three mechanisms: pp forming mechanism, role-task mechanism, the feedback mechanism. We conducted a pilot study to examine the effectiveness of collaboration in students' use of collaboration scripts and furthermore to evaluate the development of CT and math. Both quantitative and qualitative data about the students' CT skills, mathematical achievements and perceptions of collaboration scripts were collected. The results showed that the PP with collaboration scripts can improve the CT skills, mathematical achievements; facilitate higher collaborative relationship; give students good perceptions by teacher's feedback.

AB  - The disappointing results that Brazilian education has been showing in external evaluations by international organizations cause us concern. Technologies are here to stay and it is therefore necessary, in some way, to change this paradigm with regard to the role that the teacher plays, from consumer to producer of technological resources. And, trying to contribute to this extremely complex scenery, this paper intends to show how a proposal launched in teacher education combined aspects of gamification and computational thinking, aiming to bring another look at teaching practice, or at least, increase the pedagogical repertoire of fellow Science and Mathematics teachers who participated in the meeting promoted by the Department of Education of the city of Taubaté, in the state of São Paulo. As a proposal, a suggestion of gamified activity in the style of a game known as “escape room” was presented, using the Google Forms tool. We note that insecurity with technological tools or lack of knowledge about some features of these same tools is still a factor that causes many concerns among teachers. We concluded that reflection on ourpractice is fundamental, and, in a way, we realize that we have managed to broaden our horizons about the use of certain technological tools.

We were interested in the frequency of this phenomena, awareness and general experience of adolescents with sexting and in general in Instagram social network security regarding adolescents. Results in terms of the danger of this phenomena are clear and demonstrable: a significant amount of the teenagers came across with it. The linkage and necessity of awareness in terms of secure behaviour on the internet and relevance with computational thinking is obvious but out of scope of this work.

We identified 21 publications in SCOPUS and coded them for comparison and synthesis. Through a meta-analysis, we found a medium effect size (g =0.656; p<; 0.001) supporting the influence of CS learning on students' change of perception of CT. Through qualitative synthesis, results show that CS learning experience influences perception of CT in terms of self-efficacy, behavioral & emotional engagement, and awareness of careers. Findings provide insights to facilitate CT education strategies and promote educational equity in the STEM field.

AB  - Computational thinking is one of the aspects emphasised in the Malaysian education system. However, the learning aids in the form of mobile applications that support computational thinking for mathematics are very limited in Malaysia. With that notion, this study aims to develop a mobile app for conceptual recognition pattern which is one of the skills in computational thinking for secondary school mathematics. The ADDIE model comprises of five phases which are analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation are used as references for the development purpose. The earliest three phases of the ADDIE model focus on the aspect of application development. While the last two phases involve the aspects of appraisal from the applications which has been developed and it involved 23 mathematics teachers. Questionnaires with Likert Scale were used in the study as instruments to measure the five main aspects of the applications which are facilitation, usefulness, design, knowledge and suitability. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics based on frequency and percentage. The results of the analysis showed that the majority of respondents gave positive feedback on the five aspects measured in using the application. In conclusion, the mobile app of the pattern recognition concept for computational thinking skills for this mathematics subject has been agreed by the respondents to have good characteristics and brings great potential for the use by teachers and students in mathematics' classes.

AB  - Advances in computer technology have expanded our capacity to solve problems on a scale never imagined, using strategies previously unavailable to us. Today’s "digital natives" have grown up in a world where technology is rapidly evolving, creating new fields of study, new types of jobs, and requiring new skill sets. Algorithmic and computational thinking are foundations for solving different problems from all domains and are not always closely related to computers and programming. They are currently primarily used in teaching computer science and STEM subjects but can be applied to all subjects and in all life situations. The paper presents the need to develop computational thinking in various subjects of primary education, with particular emphasis on combining digital ("plugged") and non-digital ("unplugged") activities, as well as on the development of algorithmic thinking. Four methodological scenarios with activities for the development of algorithmic thinking in primary education are presented.

AB  - Research and full paper. Digital games are increasingly a part of our daily lives and are already considered teaching and learning tools. However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area. The results of the exploratory study show that the proposed approach can favor the development of computational thinking, as well as motivate the production of texts, developing students' reading and writing skills, therefore contributing to the improvement of learning assessments.

AB  - Teaching with educational robots is increasingly being integrated into the curriculum. However, many teachers, and especially those who have been in practice for a long time have not been trained in this area. Therefore, in-service teacher training in educational robotics is now an important area. In the framework of the Erasmus FERTILE project, materials on this topic have been developed. Based on these, teacher training is being implemented in several European countries in 2024. Participants are introduced to educational robotics in combination with arts, with a particular focus on the development of computational thinking skills. In this paper, we focus on the final part of the training, in which a peer assessment using a rubric was used to evaluate the projects created. We demonstrate the inter-rater reliability of the rubric applied and use the results of the peer assessment to verify the participants' level of understanding of computational thinking.

AB  - In this paper, we describe an interdisciplinary approach using STEM to solving a real-world problem involving poaching. This integrated STEM experience helped a team of researchers that included students from K-12, undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty to collaboratively understand, design and test potential solutions to the problem. The team employed an engineering based Design-Thinking framework combined with effective brainstorming strategies that have been well-established in business, marketing and commercial environments along with a computational mathematics problem solving approach. Not only this integrated STEM experience provided an opportunity for the team of researchers to develop professionally but also gave them an opportunity to become change agents to transform institutional practices and to engage the broader community to inspire the next generation STEM workforce. Specifically, the project framework guided the research team to propose potential integrated STEM based solutions including the application of drones to track illegal poaching as well as the development of an intelligent sensor based tracking system which are validated via sophisticated mathematical and probabilistic algorithms. This overall experience has clearly helped to establish STEM education partnerships and alliances outside traditional boundaries and has helped to create new synergies for all stakeholders who are invested in solving the problem of poaching. Specifically, it has helped to develop an international research experience for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who now have a unique perspective on solving real-world problems in developing countries. The program has helped to promote the much needed awareness of using STEM based solutions to solve global challenges through a multi-disciplinary collaborative approach involving students and faculty from mathematical sciences and engineering who continue to collaborate.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of a robotics-based learning environment using an educational design research approach. Contemporary teaching should prepare learners for everyday and working life, suggesting that this can only be achieved by implementing Digital Education from primary education onwards. Since computer science education is planned to be anchored in the Austrian primary school curriculum as an interdisciplinary competence development, research into teaching methods and content suitable for this area is becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling. Hence, the development of the learning environment and the didactic approach gained from qualitative results of interviews and observations from the first cycle of the research project are presented, providing plausible arguments for further implementing this robotics-based learning environment.

AB  - This Research-to-Practice Full Paper examines the Bebras Challenge tasks, a Computational Thinking (CT) contest that does not require programming knowledge. Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is defined as the thought process of formulating problems and expressing their solutions. In recent times, children increasingly program and CT is a fundamental skill to master. Research shows children often lack such skill. In this work, we contribute an analysis of the ROOT robot system and its associated curriculum to aid in the development of CT skills in children aged 4–10 years old (in China). In particular, we measure the concepts of abstraction, analysis, generalization, algorithmic thinking, logical thinking, sequential problem solving, self-confidence, and self-checking capability throughout a 10-week course. The results show 71% students developed “Excellent” CT performance and 29% achieved “Good” performance. The key lesson is that children's CT skills develop positively when programming with the ROOT learning platform.

AB  - While there is growing recognition of the need to support young learners as they develop computational thinking (CT) skills, this paper advocates for an increased focus on computational identity (CI) and digital empowerment (DE) in particular, as we posit that these CT skills will help young learners become self-motivated, innovative creators. When nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development tools. This paper advances two key approaches to address these issues: 1) A critical computational literacy approach to engage youth in developing personally meaningful applications that have impact in the real world; 2) the use of a tool, like MIT App Inventor, that lowers barriers to creating useful, impactful technology. Using two case-based studies, we show how these two approaches have supported youth in developing applications that respond to meaningful challenges in their communities and helped them to establish their computational identities and digital empowerment.

AB  - The computational processing methods appeared to overcome the drawbacks of the symbolic processing method. Recently the serious limitations of the computational processing methods have been found through the development of the highly intelligent user interface systems. The simple solutions to the limitations are the return to the symbolism or the use of the hierarchical system architecture. However it is indispensable deeply to combine the symbolic and computational processing in order to realize the highly intelligent system. The leading attempts toward the combination of computational and symbolic processing are overviewed. The level of the combination is not deep, high and wide enough. Our approach based on the emergent recurrent neural network and the language processing toward the deep fusion of symbolic and computational processing is proposed. In this new architecture, the symbolic processing and the computational processing should affect each other at anytime, at anywhere and at any abstract level.

Firstly, the definition, classification and function of design sketch are explained. Secondly, its importance in the product design process is analyzed. Then design sketch is compared with computer rendering. The uncertainty of design sketch is presented to reveal its ambiguity. Thirdly, the relationship between the ambiguity of design sketch and creative thinking is discussed. Finally, the teaching points of design sketch are proposed from two aspects of presentation techniques and training contents. Appropriate drawing tools and techniques should be chosen according to the characteristics of different stages of the design process and progressive training should be insisted on, so that design sketch can really serve as a primer for the successive courses of product design.

AB  - The CDIO Framework within engineering education is based on the idea that graduates should be capable of conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating (i.e., CDIO) complex systems within a team-based learning environment. As an approach to engineering education, it aims to create an active, experiential learning setting where product and process are considered fundamental to the curriculum. Modern pedagogical strategies and innovative teaching methods allow for the implementation of the CDIO approach, where students are supported to develop deep knowledge, manage the process of designing and exploiting new items and systems, and evaluate the impact of the scientific-technological process on society. This article will highlight aspects of this approach in the development of a practical quantum electronics session. In particular, it will focus on the developed principles of an innovative practice-targeted programme that can support the development of students' engineering thinking through the linkage of education and professional activities. As graduates, the students will need to be able to create innovative engineering systems as well as integrate their understanding of natural and technological sciences to generate novel concepts. They will also need to be proficient in professional ethics and have knowledge of business and entrepreneurship fundamentals. As such, this indicates the need for a strategically-focused curriculum that supports the development of a range of transversal skills required for industry. In this paper, the CDIO model is detailed as a means of transforming engineering education on a large scale. In order to develop the fundamental framework of creative awareness sessions for quantum technologies and their applications, this study attempted to further explore and provide more specific illustrations of the concepts relating to CIDO and to consider how they may be applied within an engineering context. The current work will present and evaluate the principles of an innovative teaching technique aimed at providing students with the opportunities to understand pioneering technologies for future applications.

AB  - In recent years, with the rise of the concept of Computational Thinking, the issue about College Computer teaching reforms has received wide attention. A high percentage of the research nowadays focuses on how to impart knowledge of computer in the perspective of computational thinking. But more importantly, the research ignores an important way to train thinking - practice. This paper starts with the “College Computer Curriculum”, which is the first computer course for undergraduate students. By using virtual reality technology, this paper gives the college teacher an experimental design method of “College Computer Curriculum”. Some exploratory research works have been performed to explain how to embody the basic problems of computer public course. Finally, we introduce a set of virtual experiment libraries, which are independent research and development. These experiments have already achieved excellent results in the practical teaching of college computer curriculum.

AB  - Computational Thinking education and training are considered crucial activities to achieve success in later challenges like computer programming. To train the brain to think in logical terms it is necessary to use adequate resources. In this paper we address the difficult problem that is assessing efficacy of a given resource to the Computation Thinking development. To discuss that topic we will use the Melodic System which is a physical learning resource capable of constructing melodic sequences in a logical manner to be used by visually impaired people. Melodic was created aiming at training Computational Thinking through music and sounds and its impact in the learning process must be evaluated. This paper presents the tests and results applied to this intent, while also providing a general and summarized presentation of the Melodic System itself.

AB  - Algorithm has been heavily used to provide a comfort life for us: from finding the best route in Google map to biometrics authentication on your phone. The significant of algorithm defines Computational thinking (CT) as one of the 21st Century skills. Although CT has been integrated into the education in the past years, many students still struggle with CT concept due to the complication of the topic and limited learning methods provided in school environment. To provide alternative learning approach for algorithmic thinking, we propose a game-base learning system called Protobot. Protobot requires students to apply their CT knowledge, especially the algorithmic thinking to solve problems in the gameplay. The experimental results demonstrate that Protobot fosters the algorithmic thinking skill of the players as well as provides the amusement during the gameplay.

AB  - Computational thinking and creative thinking are valuable tools both within and outside of computer science (CS). The goal of the project discussed here is to increase students' achievement in CS courses through a series of computational creativity exercises (CCEs). In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Computational thinking is one barrier to enculturating as a professional engineer. We created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD) as an instructional tool that can identify at-risk first-year engineering students. The purpose of this study is to provide construct validity, internal consistency reliability, item characteristics, and criterion validity evidence for this diagnostic. From fall 2020 to fall 2021, 469 students from three institutions in the United States took the diagnostic. The data from 152 students at one institution was used to provide evidence of predictive validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach  $\alpha $  of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades. The ECTD can have a broad impact because it provides a tool to gauge the entry-level skills of students, enabling early curriculum interventions to help retention and persistence to graduation. We make the case that the ECTD could contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce in engineering.

AB  - Design thinking is the method of thinking that comes from human experiences. This method is already popular for developing inventions. The Indonesian ministry of research, technology, and higher education tend to prioritize improving students' innovative skills. This report is an example of applying design thinking methods at the Informatics Engineering Department, Hasanuddin University, Indonesia. The perspectives of the design thinking method on computer network design and implementation are described. The subject named “Special Topic of Computer Network” is used as a case to study the method. The student's perspectives are gathered by the survey. The data on students' desire for lecturing method have been carried out. The study receives good responses and results from participated students. To get results that are in accordance with the learning objectives of the department, further qualitative research analysis is carried out using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The analysis shows that the design thinking method is one of a good learning alternative to be applied in the future.

AB  - Several initiatives have been created to promote Computational Thinking (CT) abilities in students. There are multiple approaches of assessing CT and wide abilities and skills involved. However, the evidence on how to assess CT has not yet been systematically grouped or reviewed. The goal of our study is to identify and classify approaches to promote CT and the different ways of assessing CT abilities. To achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was planned and executed. The results reveal that: (i) programming courses are the most common pedagogical approaches to promote CT for K-12 students; (ii) multiple skills are involved in CT, but solving problems, algorithms, and abstraction are most common abilities assessed; and (iii) codes and multi-choice questionnaires are the most common artifacts for assessing CT abilities. This study points out to the fact that there are open questions for exploring and developing new researches for promoting and assessing CT abilities.

AB  - Computational models and simulations can be powerful tools to help learners understand a wide variety of natural phenomena. However, understanding and learning from computational models requires learners to comprehend the rules agents follow that lead to emergent outcomes. Blocks-based programming is useful in scaffolding learners in the early stage of programming tasks. We posit that students can authentically interact with agent-based modeling via a blocks-based dialect of the popular ABM language NetLogo, dubbed NetTango, across many difficulty levels. Specifically, we discuss three different activities in which we have integrated blocks-based programming into STEM classrooms that show blocks can be used for activities of increasing computational engagement and difficulty.

AB  - Cognitive testing is concerned with quantitative and qualitative evaluation of an individual's intellectual functioning in its broad sense. Tests for evaluating cognitive components are based on submitting the subject to a given task and then assessing performance according to an established set of reference parameters. In order to analyze subject's behavior and test results, a software tool was developed based upon digital ink technology, which permits the digitalization of the assessment procedure, from the undertaking of the test to the production of the assessment results. By doing so, the test procedure is computerized and its data is saved in InkML format and processed to analyze tasks previously defined by the evaluator. We have used this tool to develop a Computational Thinking test defined within the Cattell-Horn-Carroll CHC framework of intelligence. Further investigating the relationship between fluid intelligence and computational thinking allows a better understanding of the main set of cognitive skills which need to be developed by students and professionals that aim to work in this domain. Moreover, it is suggested that assessments, independent of their context, may benefit from using the InkML tool, mainly due to the richer set of information that can be collected.

AB  - This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development and implementation of an innovative online adaptive gamification platform for learning Computational Thinking (CT). CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is an essential skill in digital society. With the growing momentum in integrating CT into K-12 education, a higher need can be seen in developing proper assessment tools to measure what students have learned about CT. Although numerous attempts have been made to design CT assessment tools, there is a scarcity of well-validated tests for summative assessment aimed at lower primary students. To bridge this gap, we designed the Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primacy (CTt-LP), targeting students aged 6–8. This study presents the test design, content validation, and pilot testing. For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2. Results indicate that the test is balanced regarding the difficulty level for the target group. Item analysis was conducted for each item, based on which decisions about the refinement of the test were made. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Computational thinking (CT) is a term invented by “J.M. Wing, 2006” to describe a set of thinking skills, behaviors, and approaches that are integral to solving complex challenges using a computer and widely applicable in the information society. CT is a must for today’s and tomorrow’s talent. The added-value of this early exposure to CT is that it will help juniors to shape a solid basis of algorithmic and data structures, which form the basic nuts and bolts of the mechanics of computer programming. The added value of developing professionals has its clear impact on the economy perspective, in light of the forecasted demand for today and tomorrow. (World economic forum, 2017) Computer programming is an outstanding way to develop computational thinking skills. It has been taken programming as a useful way for juniors to learn problem solving and computational thinking with an affirmative and quantifiable effect on juniors’ achievement, not only in areas such as math and science, but also in language skills, creativity, interpersonal skills and social emotional interaction.

AB  - The modern board game market (MBG) has been evolving gradually, and its mechanics appear to support concepts of Computational Thinking (CT). Seen as pedagogical resources applicable in the classroom context, this study analysed 10 MBGs with the aim of identifying aspects that can promote the development of CT, with a special focus on the modern board game 'Rossio.' Building upon the LM-TM model, an adapted version of the LM-GM model for board games, we propose a new framework that relates Computational Thinking learning mechanics (CTLM-TM) with tabletop game mechanisms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills are generally regarded as a basic ability for problem-solving and are gradually filtering down to younger age groups. Existing research has attempted to increase interaction and enhance the learning interest of elementary school students through block-based programming environments represented by Scratch. However, criticism suggests that this approach has potential long-term constraints on CT education. Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students’ learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments. A total of 108 fifth-grade students participated in the experiment and were divided into two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) and a control group (CG). The students in experimental groups all undertook game-based learning, while EG1 students used C++ and EG2 students used Scratch; CG students used C++ for traditional algorithm-based learning. Findings suggest that traditional programming languages with game-based learning can also substantially improve learning interest, which can promote the efficiency of improving CT for students who already have some motivation and foundation for learning. But for students who still lack motivation, are also encouraged to develop an interest in a block-based programming environment. Teachers can choose the most appropriate approach for students to find the best balance between learning efficiency and long-term interest.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is vital in today's digital era, especially in Engineering Education. While no official policy or teaching framework on CT education has been established in the Netherlands, a Western European country, there have been various initiatives for the integration of CT into the curriculum. Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in CT integration, we surveyed the perceptions and intentions of teachers in tertiary education in the Netherlands. Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities. To foster the integration of CT in tertiary education, our findings suggest the need for further development of higher education teacher training programs focused on CT and its relation to CS. Additionally, there is a call for further exploration of how to enhance teachers' performance expectancy and effort expectancy.

AB  - Research Purpose and Contribution: The study aimed to construct an evaluation framework for assessing pupils’ computational thinking (CT) during classroom learning problem solving. As a self-report evaluation scale for pupils, this evaluation framework further enriched the CT assessment instruments for pupils and provided a specialized instrument for experts to evaluate pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations during classroom learning. Background: CT cultivation and assessment methods are hot topics in the field of education. CT assessment can effectively test the effect of CT cultivation. There are many CT assessment methods, of which evaluation frameworks are an effective self-reporting assessment method. Existing studies on self-reported CT evaluation frameworks are commonly applicable to students at different stages. However, few studies have focused on the specific context from the perspective of practice for pupils. Thus, the evaluation framework of pupils’ CT is worth exploring. Intended Outcomes: A CT evaluation framework for evaluating pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations in classroom learning was constructed to facilitate researchers’ understanding of pupils’ CT levels and problem-solving skills. Application Design: In this study, data from 897 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades were collected using an online questionnaire that included 27 items about CT. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item analysis were conducted to analyze the data in this study, with 17 items remaining in the final evaluation framework. Findings: The fitting validity, convergence validity, and discriminant validity all met the recommended criteria, which showed that the evaluation framework was effective. The total reliability of CT was 0.911, indicating that the consistency and reliability of the evaluation framework constructed in this study were satisfied.

AB  - Efforts to broaden participation in computing have revealed the need for a deeper theoretical and empirical understanding of how girls of color form computing identities. In this paper, we use the concept of identities-in-practice as an analytical frame to examine how girls of color engage in computational thinking practices. Our research investigates how the identities of girls of color can be leveraged as funds of knowledge in learning spaces and asks the following research question: How does centering the identities of girls of color impact their engagement with computational thinking practices? We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences. By focusing on the girls' identities, the program re-imagines computational experiences by fostering interactions with computational thinking from a personal perspective. Ultimately, we argue that centering girls' identities should be viewed as an integral part of the learning process and not tangential.

AB  - Presents an analysis of the issues pertaining to computational emergence and emotion in (cognitive) agent systems whether their ecology is carbon or silicon-based. We consider how a developing computational theory of cognition can be used to monitor and manage interactions with and within complex systems and so harness unwanted and emergent states and behaviours before the computational system becomes dysfunctional. A comparison is made between these emergent computational states and emotional states. The opening scenario provides a global systems context for the interaction between man and the cyber-domain. The final focus of the paper weaves these threads together in a consideration of the nature of goals, emotion and philosophical issues related to (computational) modelling.

AB  - The contribution of this paper is the introduction of an abstract sensor-actuator pair to the subsumption architecture of robots introduced by Brooks (1987). The perceiving side of this pair derives from Gibson's (1979) affordance, which is a form of grasping of situations involving perceived objects. This study is part of a new form of evolutionary robotics called cognitive robotics. It considers a new context for a classical form of learning, namely, habitation. The inspiration for the form of affordances described in this paper comes from Heidegger's (1982) notion of the convergence of the concurrent activities of building, dwelling and thinking. In some sense, building and dwelling are at the threshhold of thinking. A brief description of the form and functioning of abstract S-A pairs is given.

AB  - This paper analyzes the deficiencies in the design of the current postgraduate education management system, proposes new ideas for the interactive design of the postgraduate education management system under the guidance of the principle of design thinking. Data collection and comparative analysis are carried out on the current situation of the Chinese graduate education management system, and through interviews and questionnaires we collected information about teachers' and students' opinion of the current system. Through SPSS regression analysis, combined with interview records, we found the main problems of the current system on interactive design and function design. Based on the design thinking theory, the improvement method of the system is proposed, which can make the process of communication and interaction between teachers and students more effective, with the goal to improve the quality of postgraduate education as a tool of academic research.

AB  - This paper presents metaViz, an online application that uses computational metaphor identification to find conceptual metaphors in political blogs. The application presents those metaphors to users in an interactive, visual fashion, with the goal of fostering critical thinking and creativity. This paper describes the computational techniques and interface design of metaViz, and presents an evaluation of the tool based on a controlled experiment showing that metaViz is more effective at fostering critical thinking than blog reading alone. This research draws attention to the need for tools that facilitate blog reading while encouraging critical engagement with the text, helping to lay the groundwork for enabling new ways of reading and interacting with blogs.

AB  - The objective of the work was to evaluate the development of variational thinking after the application of a didactic strategy based on mathematical modeling, in civil engineering students from the Province of Abancay, in Peru. The sample was 111 students who worked in two experimental groups and in a control group. The evaluation of the development of variational thinking was carried out according to covariational reasoning. The results show that the application of the strategy allowed the development of variational thinking because it significantly improved the level of covariational reasoning, allowing students to develop and strengthen skills to coordinate the amount of change in the variables.

AB  - The aim of this article is to integrate a typical scenario plot of the Schwartz approach [25], [30] with the FCM method [3], [6]–[7] mediated by stakeholder Participatory Modeling (PM) processes, to strengthen the system thinking approach during a strategic decision-making process guided by strategic foresight. The combination of these approaches provides a better understanding of the scenario alternatives available to decision makers. This is, recognizing the context of the focal question with creative scenario plots that show the interaction between its key drivers. Therefore, the hybrid model, should be useful to unify the strategic point of view by recognizing the most plausible scenario, while reducing the uncertainty due to ambiguous value judgments by Key Decision Makers (KDMs).The work presented in this article aims to develop hybrid model by combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to engage a new non-linear form of systems thinking about the future. The article includes a conceptual model and an experimental case that develops a case for rethinking the ideas of a research system for a local organization.The article ends with a reflection on outcomes and suggests ways for future research.

AB  - To address pattern classification problems without involving complex computations, a Hash-Based Convolutional Deep-Thinking Pattern Classifier (HCDTPC) has been developed. This classifier draws inspiration from the human visual system and human thinking logic. The architecture consists of five layers, each serving a distinct purpose. In the initial convolutional layer, informative and distinct features are extracted, mimicking the functionality of the human visual system. The subsequent clustering layer employs a clustering algorithm to group samples within a class into smaller clusters. This arrangement allows the following layer to compare test samples across different clusters, replicating a human-like classification process where the most similar samples should belong to the same group. The hashing layer of the devised system employs a similarity-preserve hashing technique to transform feature maps into hashed data. This transformation reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining essential similarity information. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is employed to classify testing samples, mirroring human thought processes. The simulation section assesses the performance of the HCDTPC, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in pattern classification.

AB  - One of the major hurdles toward automatic semantic understanding of computer programs is the lack of knowledge about what constitutes functional equivalence of code segments. We postulate that a sound knowledgebase can be used to deductively understand code segments in a hierarchical fashion by first de-constructing a code and then reconstructing it from elementary knowledge and equivalence rules of elementary code segments. The approach can also be engineered to produce computable programs from conceptual and abstract algorithms as an inverse function. In this paper, we introduce the core idea behind the MindReader online assessment system that is able to understand a wide variety of elementary algorithms students learn in their entry level programming classes such as Java, C++ and Python. The MindReader system is able to assess student assignments and guide them how to develop correct and better code in real time without human assistance.

AB  - More than one third of computer science students either switch disciplines or fail the first programming class due to test/performance anxiety or learning difficulties. Personalized feedback can potentially improve both learning outcomes and retention for novice learners of computer programming. Online learning management and assessment systems have the power to allow self-paced, individualized and multi-layered learning that can be easily combined with time tested learning strategies such as pair programming, game based learning or visual programming to positively impact learning outcomes and support free-choice learning. In this paper, we introduce an online automated tutoring and assessment system, called MindReader, for introductory programming in C++. We discuss how MindReader generates personalized feedback fully automatically and prioritizes semantic error messages to avoid overwhelming the learner with a large number of signs of “failures.” We also discuss how MindReader can be used as a flexible teaching tool for introductory programming classes, and how its smart tutoring and assessment systems can improve learning.

In this review, we started with reviewing theories of parental involvement. Then we investigated and categorized types of parental involvement, parent roles, and parents’ psychological factors in the parenting process. We also supplemented a new involvement form in Level 2 of Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler’s Model of Parental Involvement in CT Education, namely parents’ support with concerns about using technology and CT tools. We proposed the Model of Parental Involvement in Computational Thinking Education. We conducted comprehensive research of related studies on parental involvement in CT education and identified the research gap in involving parents in children’s CT learning.

However, few of them focused on basic psychological needs satisfaction (BPNS) and behavioral engagement. Since needs satisfaction could influence intrinsic motivation and lead to better performance. It is critical to understand whether, and to what extent, the learners’ CT skills are influenced by the level of BPNS. In light of this, the work-in-progress study employed a semester-long intervention to explore the role of BPNS in students’ CT skill development. A total of 600 primary students participated in this study. The findings of this study will contribute to a better understanding of primary students’ motivation in programming learning.

AB  - This work aims to explore the application of the physical and digital twin pair as a computational thinking instrument to support learning and exercise proportional reasoning at the ages at which pursuing STEM studies is decided. Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8–9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8–9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.

AB  - Computational Thinking is a core capability for most engineers. The term summarizes a set of skills needed to transform real-life challenges into problems that can be solved with the help of a computer and to apply computer-based solutions to questions at hand. This mindset is fundamental to almost every engineering task. However, teaching Computational Thinking is a great challenge for educators worldwide. In designing and implementing university curricula, one has to take an increasing number of arguments into consideration. Technological progress requires the design, creation, and analysis of increasingly large and complex systems. Engineering working environments and tasks demand interdisciplinary teams and close communication between involved groups. In designing engineering curricula, these factors need to be considered and the necessary skills must be implicitly or explicitly developed. This paper highlights three examples of classes and projects aimed at enabling students to develop and increase Computational Thinking through systematic introduction of computational tools. From these successful case studies, the paper derives six best practices for fostering Computational Thinking in engineering education. A review of several examples is given, that are used to highlight and extract best practices. This provides a comprehensive overview of the relationships and simplifies the application of the aforementioned principles to course and curriculum designs.

Scratch is a visual programming language used by youth to design programs like animation, game, or music. Their computational thinking skills take place around program decompositions, program patterns, and data representation in the shared Scratch programs (called projects). Through the exploratory work, we found that some cues, such as deep nested iteration, may be successfully used as indicators of users computational thinking skills. This suggests future directions for assessing youths computational thinking skills development and educational opportunities emerging from shared Scratch projects.

We suggest that novice programming languages might offer a starting point for nonprogrammers to engage with a substantial subset of computational thinking concepts, and assess a number of languages from this perspective. We outline four key computational thinking skills and examine the support provided by existing languages. We then describe additional characteristics which would be important for a new language aimed specifically at developing computational thinking skills.

To achieve reliable system intelligence outstanding results, current computational system modeling and simulation community has to face and to solve two orders of modeling limitations at least. As a solution, we propose an exponential, prespatial arithmetic scheme (“all-powerful scheme”) by CICT to overcome the Information Double-Bind (IDB) problem and to thrive on both deterministic noise (DN) and random noise (RN) to develop powerful cognitive computational frameworks for deep learning, towards deep thinking applications. An operative example is presented. This paper is a relevant contribution towards an effective and convenient “Science 2.0” universal computational framework to develop deeper learning and deep thinking system and application at your fingertips and beyond.

AB  - The revival of artificial intelligence (AI) a few years ago has often been attributed to the success of machine learning (ML), especially the branch of ML known as deep learning (DL). Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence. Specifically, this paper previews what thinking machines would be capable of by taking into consideration a machine's ability to abstract and reason, in addition to its ability to learn.

AB  - The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 in educational environments is rapidly transforming how undergraduate students approach problem solving tasks. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to investigate the 32 studies that were published between 2021 and 2024 in order to assess the impact of LLMs on problem solving skills. The review identifies the significant improvements in undergraduates' problem-solving effectiveness, creativity, and computational thinking. It also emphasizes the need for careful implementation of these tools to avoid potential overreliance, which may impact the student's ability to develop independent problem-solving skills. The review identifies the importance of a well-balanced integration of LLMs in education to maximize their benefits while addressing the challenges they present. Recommendations for future research directions are suggested to further explore the long-term impacts of LLMs on the development of problem-solving skills and their applicability across diverse academic environments.

AB  - Design is considered by most to be the central activity of engineering. Also, it is known that engineering programs should graduate engineers who can design effectively to meet social and environmental needs. Though the role and perception of design across a wide range of educational institutions have improved markedly in recent years; however, both, design faculty & design practitioners argue that further improvements are necessary. One of the defining characteristics of design is that there is rarely a single correct answer to an engineering problem but, rather, an optimal or acceptable solution leading to a final design, presented as the best possible balance between technical as well as non-technical constraints. These nontechnical constraints typically involve economics, politics, social and environmental issues, ethics, etc. And, while professional practitioners generally accept this understanding of design, students, by enlarge, tend to interpret the engineering design process as an unambiguous and clearly defined process supported by rigidly applied principles and processes of “the scientific method.” Students' vision and mis-concepts of design do require proper alignment with prevailing conditions on the ground. Undoubtedly, the start of any design course should be preceded by exposure to design thinking and related processes. The paper reviews the role of design in engineering programs, and outlines the current research on how design thinking processes could be taught and learned. It explores also the currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, namely: Project-Based Learning (PBL). The paper identifies several contexts for PBL, along with some available data on it success. Finally, the paper raises some of the questions that should be answered to identify the most effective pedagogical practices of improving design learning.

AB  - Both human brain and computer (electronic brain) could process data and do some cognition and computation tasks. Is the cognition of human brain equal to the computation of computer? It is obviously not. In this talk, the relationships of brain cognition models and intelligence computation models are summarized into four different types, that is, human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation (BCIIC), intelligence computation without human brain cognition (ICOBC), intelligence computation assisted human brain cognition (ICABC), and the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation (BC&IC). There are three paradigms in traditional artificial intelligence (AI) studies, that is, symbolism AI, connectionism AI, and behaviorism AI. The physical symbol system hypothesis is used in the symbolism AI. Human brain cognition is taken as a kind of symbolic processing, and the processes of human thinking are computed by symbol in the symbolism AI [1,2]. The connectionism AI relies on the bionics to simulate human brain. In the connectionism AI, neuron is taken as the basic unite of human thinking, and the intelligence is taken as the result of interconnected neurons competition and collaboration [3,4]. In the behaviorism AI, intelligence depends on the perception and behavior, “Perception-action” model is used, and intelligence may not require knowledge, knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning [5]. The symbolism AI and connectionism AI are two different types of human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation, while the behaviorism AI is a representative case of intelligence computation without human brain cognition. Usually, AI researchers get some inspiration from human brain cognition in their studies. On the other way, intelligence computation could also assist human brain cognition studies. The bidirectional cognitive computing model (BCC) is such a case. It studies the bidirectional transformations between the intension and extension of a concept. It is used to simulate some human brain cognition tasks such as learning and recognition [6,7]. Cognitive computing is one of the core fields of artificial intelligence [8,9]. Data-driven granular cognitive computing (DGCC) is an example of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation [10,11]. It takes data as a special kind of knowledge expressed in the lowest granularity level of a multiple granularity space. It integrates two contradictory mechanisms, namely, the human's cognition mechanism of ``global precedence'' which is a cognition process of ``from coarser to finer'' and the information processing mechanism of machine learning systems which is ``from finer to coarser'', in a multiple granularity space. It is data-driven cognitive computing model. The integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation would be an important research topic of artificial intelligence. Some scientific research issues of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation are discussed based on DGCC.

AB  - We present a critique of the current teaching practices of simulation. We challenge the current view of simulation, to the extent that most textbooks' contents will be found to be secondary to the missing necessary primary material. We advocate that (simulation) education has four general objectives, which are to teach students how to learn, how to think creatively, how to problem solve, and how to be professionals. These four objectives of education may not be possible to teach. In the words of Oscar Wilde, "Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught". So an education in simulation requires that students be put into learning situations that enable them to learn the requisite knowledge concerning the four objectives.

AB  - Educational game design environments are used for teaching computational thinking and software engineering concepts to novices. In software engineering education, there has recently been calls for "innovative methods for software teaching and training in online courses" (http://2014.icse-conferences.org/seet). However, to date, learning these concepts is tied to a formal learning environment and the presence of a teacher. In line with the new educational opportunities provided by the Web such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and e-learning 2.0 platforms, we have created an online educational game design environment with integrated learning resources including video tutorials, showcases, and communication tools. To understand the effect of online educational game design environments with integrated support for learning on novices' use of the system and their learning, we conducted a mixed-method study with nine participants. While the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants' interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums.

AB  - No design, no business. Higher test score doesn't represent better global competitiveness. Creativity is central to the competitive capabilities of 21st century citizens and thus creativity education should play crucial role for every grade curricular. However, the development of creative potential requires work and incubation over time. It takes more efforts than standard curricula can afford. What role can e-learning strategy with focus on science and technology have in sparking innovation? Such e-learning strategy can be the digital storybooks which convey science histories or technology innovation stories with domain knowledge, creative and critical thinking, and problem solving--the basic ingredients of creativity and innovation. Learning occurs within a real world of our daily life. The connections between learners' script memory and contextual learning materials have a positive impact on meaningful learning. Therefore, histories of scientific findings as well as technology innovations would benefit science education especially for elementary pupils. However, there are a few story-based learning materials for primary science curricula. This study design and develop a digital storybook based upon true story of Taiwan young inventors. The process of problem awareness, situation perception, idea generation, solution emergence and selection as well as action preparations are elaborated in the story. Pilot testing of target users show a strong positive attitude toward this digital storybook.

AB  - In the frames of the process of informatisation of education, the issue of the formation of optimization thinking among high school students has been considered. The formation of this kind of competences cannot be ensured by purely theoretical training; therefore, it is proposed to use models of optimal environmental management as vivid examples of solving optimization problems. The models illustrate such basic optimization concepts as the objective functional, different kinds of constraints, and the formulation of nonlinear and dynamic programming problems. Using the examples of managing the process of forest restoration, the importance of the correct selection of parameters of the model and methods for solving the optimization problem is shown. Concrete examples of using the proposed technique are given.

In this response, I argue that we should strive toward pluralism in understanding neural activity at both the emergent network and modular levels, on the bases that a purely emergent understanding would be incomplete, and that there are computational advantages to anatomically stable modularity.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) allows us to solve complex problems by expressing it in a way that computers, humans, or both, can understand. CT is closely related to problem solving and critical thinking, which are actively used in STEM education. Research on CT has gained steady momentum recently, and many of the institutions around the world have adopted CT into their curriculum. This paper presents a literature review conducted to identify the interventions used to develop CT skills and the methods used to assess CT skills. The review explored various publications on CT and identified that curriculum-based interventions and workshops are the primary interventions used for introducing CT in the educational sector. During the analysis, we have also identified a handful of assessment tools used for measuring CT skills, but they are not standardized assessment tools. Hence, we plan to analyze the existing assessment methods and propose a new sophisticated tool for evaluating CT skills as our future work.

AB  - Natural language's creative genres are traditionally considered to be outside the scope of computational modeling. Computational linguists have paid little attention to humor in particular because it is puzzling by nature. However, given the importance of humor in our daily lives and computers in our work and entertainment, studies related to computational humor will become increasingly significant in fields such as human-computer interaction, intelligent interactive entertainment, and computer-assisted education. In this article, we explore computational approaches' applicability to the recognition and use of verbally expressed humor. Particularly, we focus on three important research questions related to this problem: Can we automatically gather large collections of humorous texts? Can we automatically recognize humor in text? And can we automatically insert humorous add-ons into existing applications?

AB  - In today's growing digital era, young students' emphasis on science and technology has multi-folded into the development of computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving mindset, and better learning outcomes. Traditionally, young children who tend to perform well academically are expected to become more successful in their careers rather than the skill set they learn and develop their cognition for better opportunities. On the contrary, skill set also plays a significant role in enhancing student engagement towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. Implementing educational robots and artificial intelligence in STEM classrooms as teaching tools represents a transformative approach to modern teaching methods. Incorporating a fun-based, hands-on learning environment using programming, designing, and problem-solving tasks for students to enhance their cognitive abilities can stimulate curiosity and innovation among them. The novelty of this study is that it analyses two case studies on introducing robotics and artificial intelligence among school children of rural-based schools in Assam, India, which enhances the participating students' self-efficacy, technical knowledge, and problem-solving attitude. This study aims to analyze the impact of an enhanced learning approach on school students regarding knowledge gain, self-worth, and innovative thinking compared to traditional teaching methods. Academicians from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati have been a part of the sessions provided to children. The data collection and analysis have been approved by the participants and their school teachers. A set of questions was developed to understand some knowledge-based and perception-based parameters through pre/post-tests and draw-a-robot activity. This study demonstrates positive effect sizes (cohen’s d = 1.64 and 5.41) from both case studies and statistic t-values to support the alternate hypothesis on a greater effect of implementing enhanced teaching methods for STEM education.

AB  - The serious geological hazards occurred frequently in the last few years, which have caused heavy casualties and severe economic losses. It is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Some technologies, including cyber-physical-system (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST) as a broader vision of the IoT was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this paper we develop a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via CPS and IoT are discussed. Moreover, the security issue of the proposed system is also analyzed.

AB  - With the increasing complexity of data types, the workload of software development is also increasing, and the later maintenance of software becomes very difficult. According to statistics, the vulnerability related to complex data processing occupies a large proportion of software vulnerabilities. The existence of software vulnerability makes the software system vulnerable to attack and affects the reliability of the software system. In this paper, the upper computer system uses the HashMap structure to store the query data directly in the structure and reduce the mapping process from data to table objects. After that, the rationality of the system module is analyzed by building a complex network model, and the robustness of the system is improved by finding the key nodes.

AB  - Our study is set in an educational context: to better teach and assess 21st-century skills, such as computational thinking or creative problem solving, we propose to formalize a specific activity that involves these competencies. This activity, referred to as #CreaCube, is presented as an open-ended problem which consists of assembling a set of robotic cubes into an autonomous vehicle. We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments. This operationalization of a creative problem-solving activity is part of an exploratory research action. In addition, an effective proof of concept is described in this study.

AB  - Jeannette Wing's seminal computational thinking (CT) paper, published in 2006, set forth CT as not just a way of looking at computational problems, but as an alternative approach to solving everyday problems. We strongly support Wing's assertion. Accordingly, we report the results of our meta-analysis of CT curricular implementations since 2006. Our principle interest is in CT framings and implementations for K-12 audiences in disciplines other than computer science, thus fulfilling the broad appeal and utility originally prescribed by Wing. We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms. In conclusion, we make recommendations for improving K-12 CT curricular implementations. Our hope is that utilization of CT characteristics and principles will become more commonplace in public education, be utilized more continuously through primary and secondary grades, and be inventively applied across a more inclusive range of academic disciplines.

AB  - Quantum mechanics is a fundamental, axiom-based physical theory that describes and explains phenomena that Classical Mechanics and Electrodynamics are unable to describe. It is considered a cross disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which focuses on nature’s real complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of computing skills acquisition, through problem-based activities to offer powerful knowledge to a wide group of learners. Therefore, quantum technology knowledge should be accessible to students and teachers, in a more interactive way. In this paper, we propose contemporary and Problem based scenarios, in which students may acquire stronger mathematical, computational and modelling skills, working as real researchers. Thus, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to quantum principles, such as superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games we propose, relate to strategic games, within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. Certain Python libraries and packages are used and the didactic approach is based on game-based inquiry learning.

AB  - This work contributes to the comprehension of Bayes’ theorem inclusive Bayesian probabilities and Bayesian inferencing within the framework of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) and cognitive learning w.r.t Bloom’s taxonomy (BT). Bayes’ theorem is taken as a crucial statistical instrument employed in the development of intelligent systems and the management of risks, commonly utilized by engineers for tasks in machine learning and managerial decision-making. The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes’ theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems. Considering this, the proposed learning method in this paper elucidated the acquisition of Bayes’ mathematical formulation by leveraging computational thinking, leading to the development of a computational model. The proposed model is named the Bayesian Computational Learning Model (BCLM). Subsequently, we have probed the utility of BCLM in the design and plan of learning activities, coherent to the STEM paradigm and BT cognitive learning hierarchy.

The system consists of two major elements: AR Bot card and AR Bot app. The AR Bot card is a AR trigger for displaying learning materials and quizzes. Smartphones with AR Bot app can be used to scan the AR Bot cards, and then enter the learning units that uses visual blocky programming editor to practice various robot tasks. The motions of virtual robot can be demonstrated in the authentic scenes with AR technology via mobile devices. The AR Bot system is designed to facilitate computational thinking and STEM education in K-12 schools. In the current state of this study, the core programming editor engine of AR Bot has been developed, and the researcher team will prepare to conduct the experiments into STEM courses in a primary school in Taiwan. The AR Bot system is expected to help strengthen the interaction between teachers and students in the classroom, leverage the learning effectiveness, and reduce the cost of robot equipment for schools.

AB  - The use of computational intelligence for leveraging social creativity is a relatively new approach that allows organizations to find creative solutions to complex problems in which the interaction between stakeholders is crucial. The creative solutions that come from joint thinking-from the combined knowledge and abilities of people with diverse perspectives-contrast with traditional views of creativity that focus primarily on the individual as the main contributor of creativity. In an effort to support social creativity in organizations, in this paper we present computational intelligence software tools for that aim and an architecture for creating software mashups based on the concept of affinity space. The affinity space defines a digital setting to facilitate specific scenarios in collaborative business environments. The solution presented includes a set of free and open source software tools ranging from newly developed brainstorming applications to an expertise recommender for enhancing social creativity in the enterprise. The current paper addresses software design issues and presents reflections on the research work undertaken in the COLLAGE project between 2012 and 2015.

There are three types of coping in this framework: information support, emotional support, and esteem support. This time, we developed esteem support. In order to increase self-esteem, we focused on psychodrama techniques and developed a system to realize psychodrama using robots. The advantages of using robots include the ability to carry out a psychodrama alone and to provide privacy-friendly support. In the experiment, a scenario was created for medical staff and a robot psychodrama was performed. As a result, we showed that robots can be used for psychodrama and esteem support can be carried out by combination of robots and the chatbot.

AB  - Computational Archival Science (CAS) has been proposed as a trans-disciplinary field that combines computational and archival thinking. To provide grounded evidence, a foundational paper explored eight initial themes that constitute potential building blocks [1]. In order for a CAS community to emerge, further studies are needed to test this framework. While the foundational paper for CAS provides a conceptual and theoretical basis of this new field, there is still a need to articulate useful guidelines and checkpoints that validate a CAS research agenda. In this position paper, we propose heuristics for assessing emerging CAS-related studies that researchers from traditional fields can use in their research design stage.

AB  - Computational modeling faces two major challenges. First, because modeling has demonstrated its value for relatively simple tasks, practitioners are asking for help with tasks in increasingly complex domains. Second, as international interchanges increase in importance, military, corporate, and humanitarian leaders urgently need to capture and better understand national and regional differences. Computational modeling promises to be a powerful tool for representing complex tasks and testing the validity of these representations. Models might also support decision aids and serve as platforms for training. It's time to extend modeling to better accommodate complexity and to include the variations in behavior, roles, values, and cognition that influence international interchange.

AB  - This paper proposes a block-based programming learning environment through animated pictogram content creation named “Pictoch”. Pictograms are constructed objects at a high level of abstraction. Abstraction, decomposition, and pattern recognition, which are all core concepts of computational thinking, are also essential ability for pictogram content creation. And if the structure of pictograms can be described as a procedural program, then it is based on algorithmic thinking. Pictoch especially focuses on human pictogram. This effect of the human pictogram can be familiar with “syntonic learning.” advocated by Papert. Pictoch has the instructions for posing and motion of human pictogram, and some more essential functions for making pictograms that drawing various objects and attaching safety signs. This paper introduces this application and describes its various basic functions and additional functions for class use.

AB  - The growth of the geospatial services industry is increasing the demand for graduates with training in both geography and computational thinking (geocomputational thinking). The limited availability of learning pathways towards geocomputationally intensive jobs requires employers across the public and private sectors to choose between hiring a geographer or a computer science graduate. This collaboration of authors will initiate the formation of a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) in Southern California, as a new strategy to addresses the lack of geocomputational learning pathways.

AB  - Research shows that improving students' understanding of Computational Thinking (CT) in unplugged, science-based courses benefits their understanding of algorithmic thinking. This paper describes use of the APP approach, a UDL-based guideline of self-regulation for problem formulation and problem solving, and then presents a program of lessons designed to improve a student's CT skills through improvement of executive functioning and higher-level cognitive skills, using the APP framework to explore the field of solar weather, an underrepresented but relevant topic for 6-12 grade students. The approach has strong resonances with the POWER approach to expository writing, the scientific method, and software engineering.

AB  - From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion.

AB  - At present, there is still a lack of suitable artificial intelligence curriculum in primary and secondary schools in China. Based on a project-based learning model, an artificial intelligence course was designed for middle school-aged students. Learning objectives were deconstructed according to the five concepts of artificial intelligence, and learning contents were arranged according to the cognitive characteristics of middle school students. In the process of teaching, the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability was paid great attention, and teaching example was given at the end of the paper.

AB  - One of the most important skills for a biochemist these days is to be able to visualize a protein, find a ligand binding site, and show the three-dimensional interactions with the coordinated amino acid residues. It is important to educate a modern student how to benefit from the up-to-date scientific data and software. It is known that the primary structure of protein is of primary information content; however, the tertiary structure is more conserved. Biochemistry students are educated in a traditional way giving an importance to developing fundamental skills as well as critical thinking. In this article, we demonstrate educational approaches that incorporate computational methods in the course Biochemistry A–CHEM 370. This approach is developed at Loyola University Chicago and is based on a pedagogical method developed at Orenburg State Medical University.

AB  - Computational thinking has become a required capability in the student learning process, and digital games as a teaching approach have presented promising educational results in the development of this competence. However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course.

AB  - In this paper, we analyzed whether the ability of students to solve problems can be influenced by the implementation of Computational Thinking (CT) in the teaching of mathematics. In this sense, we performed a quasi-experiment with students in the Brazilian's Basic Education Regular System (particularly in a group of students around fifteen years old) comparing their performance after being trained with practical activities using exercises in more or less conformity with well known CT concepts and capabilities. Considering the quantitative results obtained, the experimental group outperformed the control group, which worked with exercises in more and less conformity with CT, respectively. The results were statistically significant, suggesting that bringing together CT and mathematics through proper adjustments of classroom practices can have a positive influence on students abilities of solving problems. In order to strengthen this conclusion we also performed a qualitative analysis comprising students and the teacher involved in the quasi-experiment that reinforced our quantitative results.

AB  - Developing students' Computational Thinking (CT), which is an essential problem-solving skill for people living in the 21st century, becomes an outstanding purpose of promoting engineering education in K-12 classrooms. In this paper, CT is represented through the graphical programming language Scratch according to the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick [1]. This project aims to explore the classroom effect of using graphical programming tool in learning English dialogue and investigate how to improve the integration of CT into English education with the elements of programming. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative method was adopted to collect data through class observations, programming projects, and semi-structured interviews. Nine primary students (n = 9) were the targeted participants, who attended extra-curricular lessons for computer programming using Scratch at their school in Hong Kong. The preliminary results show that the introduction of CT into English dialogue learning through graphical programming language can motivate primary school students to study English dialogue. To better connect CT with English education via graphical programming tools, students and the teacher in the group under study suggested making computers interact with people autonomically, designing games in graphical programming environments to encourage English learning, keeping the balance of students' graphical programming language learning skill and their English language skill, and adopting graphical programming language as a tool to finish the summative English language assignments.

AB  - Many countries have included or consider to include computational thinking in their educational curricula. This creates the need for a carefully planned educational approach involving different stakeholders as policymakers, educators and students. These stakeholders are the main carriers of the educational reforms thus their perspectives create various challenges and risks. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical approach of teaching coding through games and gamification of the learning process. The flipped classroom is used in order to address the shortcomings in teacher training and deliver learning outcomes in student-centred, fun and engaging way. Proposed solution includes a spiral curriculum implemented in 4 cycles that alternate cooperative and individual learning approach. The approach was evaluated with more than 199 students from 6 different schools. Evaluation analyses were focused on the achieved learning experience identifying differences between male and female students, as well as students with different level of access to ICT resources. The results confirm the benefits of the proposed solution.

AB  - The uniqueness of Augmented Reality (AR) is its affordance to support learning abstract concepts by rich information, visualization and the integration of user-content interaction. Research has shown that abstract idea and invisible phenomena can be learned better with the support of AR. However, high complexity and conceptual Computational Thinking (CT), such as algorithm design and related programming concepts, are rarely studied empirically in the intersection with immersive technology. This study is aimed at addressing this issue and providing a piece of quantitative and empirical evidence to AR-supported Computer Science discipline-based learning. We designed a mobile AR-enabled application based on a CT framework and related AR affordances in the literature. This app can contextualize a programming debugging task and support program editing & CT learning. A controlled laboratory study was designed and conducted. The result of statistical analyses shows that participants with the AR support made better quality of programs with lower errors and less amount of code edits, compared to those without the AR support.

AB  - This Research-to-Practice Full Paper evaluates an online programming course for K-12 educators that aimed to teach Computational Thinking (CT). CT is widely defined as a set of skills, such as problem solving and systems design, that rely on Computer Science principles. As these skills are increasingly demanded in modern society, it is critical to include CT in K-12 education to boost not only computing courses, but various other disciplines. However, most educators do not yet know the basics of CT and Computer Science fundamentals, particularly in Brazil. In this context, we designed and implemented an online programming course for K-12 educators to provide qualification in CT and Programming basics, as well as to assess learners' attitudes towards Computing, how their motivation are expressed during the course, and the correlation between motivation and attitudes. The results indicate that participants' attitudes towards Computing has become more positive after the course, primarily their comprehension of CT and confidence to learn Computer Science. The outcomes also suggest a high level of learners' motivation over the course, and reveal a high correlation between the relevance expressed in the course with their interest and confidence towards Computing.

AB  - The demand for additional engineering and computing degree graduates continue to increase [1, 2]; however, interest in pursuing these degrees is not matching the predicated demand. More specifically, attracting US students in engineering and computing field has always been a challenge; this is particularly true for female and minority students. Factors such as the "geek image", a demanding mathematical foundation, lack of "gee whiz" element early in the curriculum, and overall misconception about the career in these areas are all contributors to this problem. This paper describes some of our activities associated with the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) concepts to middle and high schools. The central tenet of the project is to entice students in grade 6-12 to learn some fundamental and advance topics in engineering and computing field, thereby recognizing their own ability to understand the computing and engineering topics, and potentially recognizing their interest in such topics and potential further education and career in these fields.

AB  - A Computational Thinking (CT) training program proposes a set of instruments to be used in the training, and also a set of recommendations on how to use them. To design such a program it is necessary to have a deep knowledge about the meaning of CT and its targets. Although CT skills are of paramount importance to all (since they bring numerous advantages for problem solving activities), in our context we see them as a pre-requisite for the learning of Computer Programming (CP). In order to design a CT training program supported by a rigorous framework, we decided to build an ontology that goes deeper into the underlying concepts and relates both domains, CT and CP. The outcome, OntoCnE (that stands for Ontologia para Computação na Escola in Portuguese), made clear what shall be trained in terms of reasoning to understand programming and being able to use it to solve problems using the computer. Moreover, OntoCnE also provides a clear insight on the concepts to be taught in each scholar year, as well as, on the instruments (hereafter called Learning Resources, LR) to be used in each moment for each specific purpose. This paper aims to introduce OntoCnE and demonstrates how to use it to classify LRs aiming to build a repository from where they can be picked up in a clear way. Finally, we demonstrate, through the PathIt resource, how the characterization of a concrete LR is performed in OntoCnE.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills are necessary for solving the real-world problems of today and are therefore being incorporated into K-12 curricula. Cybersecurity is of similar importance; however, it can be difficult for young learners to grasp the required concepts and use them to construct meaningful algorithms. We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development. We discuss the impact of this approach on cybersecurity and CT learning and then present future directions for this work.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) skills are a key competency for all citizens, but for Computer Programming students these abilities are crucial. Several studies claim that students have deficits in many of the CT skills and therefore it is important to develop and improve these skills. For that purpose, Teachers responsible for the children’s education have to plan as soon as possible effective ways for training CT skills. There are already many Learning Resources (LR) for this training, however, we believe that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these LR in the teaching and learning process. Currently, Educational Neuroscience presents a solid set of scientific evidence on how the brain learns more effectively. This important knowledge about the brain’s learning process can be turned into principles applicable in Education. This paper starts emphasising those principles that can benefit the teaching and learning process. Based on this scientific evidence, we propose the adoption of a set of guidelines that can contribute to innovative CT training. Neuroeducation applies the latest theoretical advances in the human brain and psychology to pedagogy. The guidelines inspired by Neuroeducation that we propose here aim to provide instructions for the teacher to apply in their pedagogical practices and in LR, in order to promote more effective training. One concrete LR for primary school, created by our Master’s Students in Computing Education, will be used, as a case study, to illustrate our proposal.

AB  - This paper examines K-12 teacher perspectives on the promise and challenges of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education for all students across three states and three school districts-one rural, one suburban, and one urban. Through a series of teacher survey and focus groups, this exploratory research presents the perspectives of K-12 teachers across three distinct vantage points: First, to what degree do these teachers see a clear value as to why CS and CT matter to their students' learning? Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/ CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity? Third, how can such a prospective pathway be practically implemented? These elements of why, who, and how are essential to wider questions around equity of student access to high quality computing, and with this paper, they come from the perspectives of teachers-a group too often left out of early discussions around K-12 curricular design. Discussion section points to how these preliminary surveys and focus groups with teachers offer an early predictor in terms of how each district develops its own K-12 computing pathway, with the expectation that such focus groups offer a powerful research/ evaluation protocol that can be repeated annually among districts to gauge to what extent teachers' hope (and concerns) about comprehensive K-12 computing pathways are warranted.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) assessment indicator assignment is an important strategy for optimizing assessment and an effective method for exploring differences in the importance of assessment indicators. However, the objectivity of the previous methods for assigning assessment indicators of CT is insufficient. Therefore, the paper proposed to use the XGBoost machine learning model to fit the assessment data, fully explore the data features and realize the weighting of CT assessment indicators. The CT assessment indicators are used as the features of XGBoost model training and the assessment levels are used as the training labels to obtain the feature weights through XGBoost model training. The feature weights are used as the CT assessment indicator weights to realize the weighting of assessment indicators of CT in reverse. From the analysis of the CT assessment indicator assignment results, the analysis of the importance of the assessment indicators and the comparative analysis of the assessment results before and after the indicator assignment, it is found that the CT assessment after the indicator assignment has higher robustness and credibility.

AB  - There is a national need to increase the number of minority students entering STEM fields with essential computing skills. To increase minority students’ interest and engagement in computing, a researcher-practitioner partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the El Paso Independent School District, developed and implemented a culturally and linguistically responsive curriculum and pedagogy to introduce computational thinking (CT) in two middle schools across different subject areas in a borderland region. The curriculum leveraged the Sol y Agua game – a bilingual, culturally-responsive game designed to engage students of this region in CT. This paper describes the process and initial findings of this project. The quantitative data from in-game analyses show that students utilized the language change feature to switch from English to Spanish more frequently than the other way – highlighting the need for educational platforms relatable to students through language, environment, and cultural context. Analyses of the qualitative data indicate that while teachers/team members understood CT and translanguaging concepts and taught lesson units that provided opportunities to practice both, CT and translanguaging were largely implicit in the curriculum. In collaborative analyses of these patterns, teachers described additional supports that would help them to make CT instruction and translanguaging strategies more explicit in the content and pedagogy, highlighting the need for systematic, targeted integration of these concepts.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for Computer Programming. We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.

AB  - This work-in-progress research paper reflects on findings from a program evaluation of a nationwide professional development (PD) initiative designed to enhance computational thinking (CT) skills among teachers in Colombia's public schools. Evaluating CT education programs presents challenges due to the limited research on the validity and reliability of data collection tools. In addition, evaluation of PD programs in CT often overlooks affective factors and fails to align with program outcomes beyond the training context, leading to insufficient evidence of their effectiveness. This study seeks to identify the factors that influence the effective implementation of CT teaching practices and contribute to the body of knowledge of professional development programs. Using a sequential mixed-methods approach, we first conducted pre-post surveys to assess changes in teachers' knowledge, followed by realist-based focus group discussions to gain deeper insights into participants' experiences and the factors influencing classroom implementation. The primary contribution of this paper is providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving changes in teachers' practices after participating in a CT-focused PD program in a middle-income country. Preliminary results indicate significant improvements in teachers' CT knowledge post-intervention. Qualitative findings highlight the importance of teachers' confidence in their CT knowledge and the need for comprehensive school support for effective CT integration.

AB  - In this section, we will report on three applications of evolutionary algorithms (EA) in real world parameter optimization. These applications show how the principles, such as robustness and representation independence, make it possible to extend the scope of optimization algorithms available so far and find answers to problems where classical solution methods fail.Evolutionary algorithms are today a state-of-the-art methodology in solving hard optimization problems, and are regularly being used in industries such as automotive and aerospace. In fact, these algorithms have revolutionized the way hard problems are being solved today. The pioneers of evolutionary computation, including Larry Fogel as one the key founders of the field, have been laying the foundations with their creativity and visionary approach toward science.

AB  - Can a robot think like a human being? Scientists in recent years have been trying to achieve this dream, and we are also committed to this same goal. In this paper, we use an example of throwing the ball into the basket to make the robots process with human-like thinking behavior. Such thinking behavior adopted in this paper is divided into two modes: fast and slow. The fast mode belongs to the intuitional reaction, and the slow mode represents the complicated cogitation in human brain. This fascinating human thinking concept is inspired by the book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, which explains the process of the human brain. In addition, the psychology theories proposed in this book are also adopted to realize the thinking algorithms, and our experiments verify that the thinking mode of human beings is reasonable and effective in robots.

AB  - Computers are often used as tools to design, implement, and even visualize a variety of narrative forms. Many researchers and artists are now further attempting to engage the computer actively throughout the development of the narrative itself. Any form of computational narrative authoring is at some level always mixed-initiative , meaning that the processing capabilities of the computer are utilized with a varying degree to automate certain features of the authoring process. We structure this survey by focusing on two key components of stories, plot and space, and more specifically the degree to which these are either automated by the computer or authored manually. By examining the successes of existing research, we identify potential new research directions in the field of computational narrative. We also identify the advantages of developing a standard model of narrative to allow for collaboration between plot and space automation techniques. This would likely benefit the field of automated space generation with the strengths in the field of automated plot generation.

AB  - This paper explores the evolving landscape of training for archival professionals in the context of big data and emerging technologies. By comparing two educational frameworks—the CAS framework, developed from computational thinking research and CAS research papers, and the InterPARES framework, based on empirical studies with archivists working with AI/ML, we identify areas of alignment and divergence. While both frameworks share significant concordance, suggesting a growing consensus on integrating computing into archival work, key differences in their approaches (learning outcomes vs. competencies) and focus areas (such as work practices, systems thinking, and cybersecurity) highlight the need for further discourse among archival scholars, educators, and practitioners. These distinctions must be addressed before formalizing CAS educational frameworks. This paper also initiates efforts to integrate emerging technological competencies by bridging the CAS and InterPARES frameworks, emphasizing the value of complementary perspectives from both professional practice and academic research. We argue that such integration is essential for developing robust competency frameworks in archival education, particularly within higher education's professional programs.

AB  - For robot intelligence and human-robot interaction (HRI), complex decision-making, interpretation, and adaptive planning processes are great challenges. These require recursive task processing and meta-cognitive reasoning mechanism. Naturally, the human brain realizes these cognitive skills by prefrontal cortex which is a part of the neocortex. Previous studies about neurocognitive robotics would not meet these requirements. Thus, it is aimed at developing a brain-inspired robot control architecture that performs spatial-temporal and emotional reasoning. In this study, we present a novel solution that covers a computational model of the prefrontal cortex for humanoid robots. Computational mechanisms are mainly placed on the bio-physical plausible neural structures embodied in different dynamics. The main components of the system are composed of several computational modules including dorsolateral, ventrolateral, anterior, and medial prefrontal regions. Also, it is responsible for organizing the working memory. A reinforcement meta-learning based explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) procedure is applied to the working memory regions of the computational prefrontal cortex model. Experimental evaluation and verification tests are processed by the developed software framework embodied in the humanoid robot platform. The humanoid robots' perceptual states and cognitive processes including emotion, attention, and intention-based reasoning skills can be observed and controlled via the developed software. Several interaction scenarios are implemented to monitor and evaluate the model's performance.

However, software engineering education has not adequately addressed integrating comprehensive data science curricula, leaving students ill-equipped for the future of artificial intelligence (AI), which is built on the foundations of data science. This gap is exacerbated by the lack of tailored courses and the intimidating nature of existing tools for begin-ners. Consequently, students often miss out on essential skills like data cleanup, real-world application of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the integration of big data in software products. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach to applied data science for software engineering students. We argue for a shift from traditional algorithm-focused teaching to a curriculum emphasizing real-world problem-solving, lever-aging data science techniques. By empowering students to define and tackle their own data-driven projects, we aim to increase motivation, enhance data literacy, and instill a data-thinking mindset in future software engineers to prepare them for the AI world. Overall, this paper contributes to the advancement of software engineering education for young learners by offering a comprehensive framework, the data action educational framework (DAEF), and a data science toolkit that enables DAEF by empowering learners to create original data-driven mobile apps.

AB  - Educational Robotics (ER) is a tool that can favor teamwork, stimulate creativity, and the ability to solve students' problems through the process of assembling and programming robots. In this sense, ER has been used to improve educational practices. There are several initiatives that seek to stimulate Computational Thinking (CT) to stand out. Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging. The main instruments for assessing students are tests, and the most significant difficulty is the limitation of class hours. Finally, LEGO® is the most used technology in class.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between two related computational thinking practices: data practices and computational problem-solving practices in acquiring related computational thinking practices during a first-year undergraduate engineering course. While computational thinking theory is still developing, empirical studies can help further understand how students demonstrate this knowledge and their progression in attaining the practices. Therefore, with this empirical study, the following questions are addressed. RQ1: What are the differences in students' computational thinking practices at the beginning of an undergraduate introductory programming course? RQ 2: How do these differences correspond to the acquisition of more advanced computational thinking practices? The use of a descriptive non-experimental design that aims to understand the correlation between practices related to data and computational problem-solving is presented. A machine learning technique is employed, utilizing historical data from introductory programming for a problem-solving course with more than 1000 first-year engineering students. After identifying groups of students defining different profiles, data from posterior performance in more advanced programming topics were descriptively analyzed. This study supports the characterization of four different student profiles demonstrating differences in their performance at the beginning of the semester. From these four profiles, two of them show a subsequent differential progression besides their similarity at the beginning of the semester. In this particular case, troubleshooting and debugging appear as a relevant competency when distinguishing these two learners' groups. These findings suggest that previous knowledge or exposure to different practices can result in different progressions of more complex computational practices, emphasizing the relevance of troubleshooting and debugging as a practice required for a successful and timely progression on the acquisition of other computational thinking practices.

AB  - Computational thinking and computer science are instrumental in learning how to creatively solve problems and develop thought out solutions. Over the years, workshops have been held to provide high school teachers the ability to teach high school students computer science, however not much has been done for middle school teachers. Funded by Google, the three day CS Educator Professional Development Workshop for Middle School Teachers at Kean University brought together teachers to learn about key computer science concepts and work with tools that were previously not known to them, such as Scratch, the Makey Makey tool kit, and the Cue robot. The results of this research find that middle school teachers need access to curriculum materials and digital tools in order to successfully teach computer science to their students. Furthermore, more work should be done to get middle school teachers access to materials and lesson plans aimed at teaching middle school students.

AB  - How to foster not only Software Programming Skill (SPS) but also Computational Thinking Ability (CTA) of students becomes more important. However, students cannot immediately understand learning problems and statuses in terms of SPS and CTA even though Scratch tool can facilitate the programming learning. Therefore, a scheme of Web-based Learning Activity Integrated with Scratch Tool (WeLaS) is proposed to assist learners. In WeLaS, students can learn the programming concepts and knowledge by sequential learning content, hands-on practice the coding skills by embedded Scratch tool, address the task by online prompts, and reflect the learning status by diagnostic report. Consequently, WeLaS can be expected to assist students in achieving the high learning performance.

AB  - Computational thinking is a skill that is considered essential for the future generations. Because of this it should be incorporated into the curricula as soon as possible. Many robots can be programmed using graphical languages or physical blocks instead of writing code. This makes programming more accessible for the youngest programmers. Looking to extend the programming activities to preschool students, we present a novel approach that allows to program a mobile robot, Robotito, by changing its environment. We describe the architecture of Robotito, software used to program its interaction with the environment, and developed behaviours. Moreover, Robotito exports his sensors and actuators using ROS standard mechanisms and is modelled in Gazebo allowing it to be used in research and undergraduate school courses providing researchers an autonomous and safety mobile platform, which can be integrated with any system using ROS.

AB  - A pod of ten unattended “behind-the-glass” computer kiosks has been running at the Raglan Road Multipurpose Centre in Grahamstown for more than three years. The goal is to enhance computational thinking skills, and to provide logic, mathematical, reading and computer literacy skills via edutainment and fun. The technology is explicitly engineered so that usage is not dependent on having willing teachers as supervisors. Initially targeted at 7-13 year old children, we've had to make adaptations for younger children from the on-site pre-primary school. We describe the innovative mechanism that allows unattended access while securing and protecting our systems. We give a brief overview of the technology and content on the kiosks, the implementation, and some observations about usage. Unusually, the project was conceived and initiated from a technical perspective, and we discuss some issues that have arisen around maintenance and division of responsibilities between the parties involved.

AB  - For a long time, pedagogy has been a social practice based on direct experiences, and many traditional teaching methods have formed. These methods were not supported by a scientific theoretical system and could not meet the fast-changing social needs. Neuroeducation is an empirical science, and an interdisciplinary subject that applies the latest theoretical advances in human brain and psychology to pedagogy. This paper explores the connection between neuroeducation and the teaching practice through the study of the latest theoretical achievements in neuroscience, cognitive neurology and psychology. Guided by theory of neuroeducation, the course content, the teaching strategy and new learning methods are proposed to improve the teaching quality of computer programming courses, while improving students' computational thinking ability.

AB  - Software engineering is defined as a discipline concerned with all aspects of software production from inception to the maintenance of a system. It has often been dubbed as the "cradle-to-grave" approach to producing reliable, cost-efficient software delivered in a timely manner that satisfies the customer's needs. It interleaves the concepts of individual work with team work and the soft skills of technical writing with technical proficiency. Therefore, as computer science educators, we are faced with the challenge of creating a learning experience for our students that effectively introduces the technical aspect of software engineering principles, as well as those essential non-technical skills. The goal of this paper is to describe a work in progress that focuses on creating an enhanced learning experience where computational thinking, collaborative learning, and service-learning are infused into an undergraduate software engineering course. The paper introduces these concepts and how each is used to train students.

AB  - Several practical engineering optimization problems are computationally demanding, requiring a large amount of computer time, processing power, and memory. These challenges can be mitigated by human-engineered systems exhibiting intelligent behavior. With the evolution of high-speed digital computers, the use of computational intelligence (CI) techniques has increased rapidly. According to Bezdek [1], “A system is called computationally intelligent if it deals with low-level data such as numerical data, has a pattern-recognition component and does not use knowledge in the artificial intelligence (AI) sense, and additionally when it begins to exhibit computational adaptivity, fault tolerance, speed approaching human-like turnaround and error rates that approximate human performance.” Another definition, by Engelbrecht [2], states that “CI is the study of adaptive mechanisms that enable or facilitate intelligent behavior in complex and changing environments. These mechanisms include those Artificial Intelligence paradigms that exhibit an ability to learn or adapt to new situations, to generalize, abstract, discover and associate.” Thus, CI is the general term used to classify all such nature-inspired methodologies and their associated theories and applications. The five important paradigms of the CI technique are artificial neural networks (ANNs), swarm intelligence (SI), evolutionary computation (EC), and fuzzy systems (FSs). The origin of each technique can be connected to a natural system; for example, an ANN imitates the biological neural system. SI models the behavior of organisms living in swarms, whereas EC models the natural evolution system. Similarly, an FS originates from human thinking processes. Many of the problems involved in designing next-generation systems can be resolved using these CI techniques or their combinations.

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) can explore common, vast and unsafe places at low cost. They could transform multiple sectors from photography to farming to city planning. However, the software underlying UAS is complex and requires multiple distinct programming skills, e.g., AI, machine learning and flight control. Few programmers encompass these skills, hampering software development and dampening the impact of UAS. We contend that early exposure to UAS software could help align workforce skills. However, early exposure requires curriculum that (1) captures the breadth of UAS software, (2) supports multiple levels of depth for diverse programming backgrounds and (3) fits within resource and institutional challenges. We propose a computational thinking framework. In our approach, lessons fit within 20-30 minute instructional blocks, making them usable in short workshop and extended classroom settings. UAV topics and computational thinking depth link lessons. Teachers can trade breadth for in-depth coding and vice versa. In early work, we presented an autonomous UAS to middle school students. Our 1 hour workshop focused on breadth and was received well.

AB  - Math Word Problem, abbreviated as MWP, constitute a class of elementary mathematical application scenarios, commonly encountered within primary secondary educational curricula. Such problems are characterized by their presentation in natural language, eschewing the utilization of intricate mathematical symbols or formulas. The focal task of model geared towards addressing Math Word Problem is twofold: first, to discern and interpret the mathematical concepts encapsulated within the textual descriptions provided, and second, to formulate an appropriate mathematical expression or equation reflective of the problem's essence. Subsequently, these models proceed to compute the solution corresponding to the derived expression, thereby completing the problem-solving process. Currently, advancements in this domain primarily revolve around improvements to encoders and decoders within models, with a relatively narrow scope of thinking processes during model solving. Consequently, the efficacy of expression solving for complex semantic Math Word Problem remains to be enhanced. In contrast to the prevalent sequence-to-tree approach, humans often employ a top-down thinking process to solve Math Word Problem. We introduce a Math Word Problem solving model featuring a dual-thinking structure, comprising a top-down solver, a step-by-step anthropomorphic thinking solver, and a consistent comparison learning module. By aligning expressions derived from two distinct solvers at multiple granularities to maintain consistency, we aim to enhance reasoning correctness. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, particularly in achieving notable improvements in solving accuracy for complex problems.

Analyze the basic operating principles of visual cognitive technology, and build a corresponding visual cognitive computing model. Under this model, the students' remote ideological and political teaching system is used as a platform to collect real-time behavior data, and the standardization of initial image data is realized from two aspects: grayscale and geometry. In the processed data, the visual cognitive computing model is used to determine the target position of the student's learning behavior in the screen, and the target moving contour and blinking behavior characteristics are extracted within the location area, so as to realize the extraction of the behavior characteristics of students' ideological and political online learning. Simulation experiments show that the method has a large number of correct recognition of students' ideological and political online learning behavior characteristics, the extraction results are more accurate, and the extraction efficiency is high.

AB  - Presents KAP (Kinematic Analysis Program), a computer program that solves planar higher-pair kinematic problems. KAP is a direct attempt to mirror human capacities to reason about kinematic problems using mental imagery. We implement the spatial and multi-scale nature of the visual buffer as a pyramid of occupancy arrays, and also present computational realisations of the attention window, cued attention shifts, the shape shift subsystem and the visual routines underlying the process of reasoning about object interactions. We contrast this approach to mainstream AI approaches to kinematic reasoning to demonstrate KAP's utility not only as a successful cognitive model but also as an embodiment of a promising paradigm for a problematic class of spatial reasoning problems.

AB  - In this paper, a general model for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), that captures the diffusion of attacks from the cyber layer to the physical system, is studied. In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game, the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is considered. Moreover, the results show that the defender's incentive to deviate from the Nash equilibrium decreases when faced with an attacker that has high computational ability.

AB  - The scientific and reasonable evaluation indicators that can fully reflect the various dimensions of students' computational thinking (CT) skills is the basis and premise of accurately evaluating students' CT skills, which is of great significance to the cultivation of students' CT skills. However, the current research on how to construct the evaluation indicators is still inadequate, and most of the research is put forward by the subjective experience of researchers, lacking objectivity and the universality of ability. In the paper, we comprehensively reviewed the concepts of CT in the theoretical literature of CT, aiming to construct the comprehensive and effective evaluation indicators of CT for students by clustering the keywords of CT concepts and extracting indicators. The validity of indicators is verified by qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis and expert evaluation. The results show that the evaluation indicators of CT constructed by spectral clustering technology are a more scientific, more comprehensive reflection of the ability dimensions of CT. It has unique advantages in constructing objective and comprehensive evaluation indicators and provides an evaluation basis for the evaluation practice of CT skills.

AB  - A grand challenge of the computer science (CS) for all education movement is the preparation of thousands of teachers with high quality, accessible professional development (PD) that has evidence of improving teacher knowledge and pedagogical practices necessary to support the learning needs of diverse groups of students. While regional PD programs can provide in-person learning opportunities, geographic and time constraints often inhibit participation. This article shares findings from an online PD program modified from the existing in-person exploring computer science PD program to provide teachers a facilitated online learning community model to support their first year teaching the course. The findings from this study have implications for future directions in the CS education field, indicating that this model of online PD, heavily based on shared experience among participants, can increase CS teachers’ confidence in adapting and delivering lessons designed to be engaging and accessible to all students.

AB  - One core issue in reinforcement learning is the balance between exploration and exploitation. Pure exploitation makes the agent reach the partial optimal solution quickly. Exploration avoids the partial optimal solution but too much exploration will reduce the performance of the Q -learning algorithm. How to avoid the partial optimal solution and find the global optimum solution is one of key goals of action selection in Q-learning. In this paper, the thinking of tabu search algorithm is introduced in order to balance exploration and exploitation of Q-learning. The optimized algorithms called T-Q-learning is proved to have a faster convergence rate and avoid the partial optimal solution in the experiments.

Firstly, modeling the SoS architecture based on a set of architecture products and Activity-Based Methodology (ABM) using Object Process Methodology (OPM), which shows a system engineering thinking. Secondly, based on the OPM/DoDAF Meta-model (DM2), from the view of Top to Down, we planned to characterize useful and insightful relationships between the SoS architecture model and its Design Structure Matrix (DSM), then studied the SoS architecture alternative trade space exploration problems with bi-layer mapping. Thirdly, based on the OPM/DM2, from the view of Down to Top, a method of mapping OPM/DM2 to Multi-Agent Simulation (MAS) was proposed. This will encourage a closer collaboration between the system architect and the analyst.

AB  - Sustainability and circular economy are promoted by the UNSDGs. However, UNEP has suggested localization prior to development, and harmonization, to aggregate impacts across spatial scales and across different taxonomic groups, applicable to all resources, to address emergent crosscutting issues across regions and models. This study posits that based on design thinking, sustainable investing/asset management theory needs to be situated within societal needs, to cater to differentiated needs, diverse capability maturity levels, and different flavours of reuse. Thus, instantiating from the Knowledge-Requirements Engineering frameworks, this study aims to review, simplify and localize sustainable investing concepts. To cater to different scenarios, a Knowledge-Requirements Engineering-Lifecycle Thinking-Innovation Helixes framework is proposed; intertwining expansive framing and UNEP's intrinsic value, pivoting via instrumental values, localized to cultural values, analogical to online shopping drivers, to enhance absorptive/ multiplicative/ relational capacity/capability, transformative innovations, across SDGs. Hopefully, the framework can interconnect/recommend/transform metaverses/ (eco)systems/ ecologies/assets more reflectively, effectively and efficiently.

Based on the Grounded Theory, this research proposed a feasible supplemented method, extensible requirements elicitation and analysis process (XREAP), by emerging lateral thinking. The thinking level of the XREAP will cover the entire requirements scope as possible as it could. To verify this theoretical method, an experimental tool is implemented and utilized some systems to metric the differences between traditional and XREAP methods by the use case points approach. The XREAP can analyze requirements at the first step of the software development process, provide dimensional thinking to enhance the requirements analysis process, let the afterward development process trust the outcome of the requirements analysis phase, promotes the work efficiency and software quality undoubtedly, and significantly improves existing solutions.

AB  - The word “competence” is often used in association with education. It is thought that exercises with direct application of theoretical knowledge help students not only to deepen theoretical knowledge but also to awaken curiosity and to make the pupils go for learning. As competences imply the capability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications, interdisciplinary education opens big opportunities not only to deepen the knowledge but also to ensure competent application of knowledge. Therefore, lecture projects have been performed in order to broaden and deepen interdisciplinary aspects in a vocational education and training college during the last five years. The topics involved have been computer-aided engineering, measuring and handcraft as well as different theoretical lectures in engineering. The outcome of the presented study is on the one hand a comparison of individual feedback of the involved students to the teacher with results of university research and on the other hand a discussion about observations based on a SWOT analysis, which summarizes the most important statements according to the performed lectures.

We utilize temporal data consisting of 3D joint positions, to construct a series of classifiers that can predict whether the subject appeared to possess reflective thinking ability during the given instance. We tackle the challenge of highly imbalanced data by incorporating and analyzing several meaningful data augmentation techniques and handcrafted features. We then feed different features through a number of machine learning classifiers and select the best performing model. We evaluate our predictions on multiple metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and MCC to work towards a generalized solution for the real-world dataset.

AB  - This article explores the impact of episodic precedents and semantic precedents on creative design. It is found that although most of designers prefer episodic precedents than semantic ones, the two kinds of precedents can help designers in different design phases. When creating initial ideas, episodic precedents help designers to generate more design concepts; when refining ideas, semantic precedents help to make ideas more complete and reasonable. Based on the above discovery, it is suggested that to produce design plans more efficiently, designers refer to suitable precedents in the different design phases.

AB  - In recent years, the interest in introducing programming activities into the classroom has increased, emphasizing the importance of promoting computational thinking in young learners. Robotics-based learning environments are intended to facilitate the learning of programming at the primary level and support developing skills such as collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving thinking in a cross-curricular approach. An Austrian research project focuses on developing and implementing a robotics-based learning environment using the educational design research approach to gain insights into the introduction of computational thinking in primary education. This paper reports on a study to identify preliminary design principles of the learning environment that form the basis of the prototyping cycle of the overall research. Data were collected by interviewing seven experts who have theoretical and practical expertise on educational robotics in primary education. The resulting six preliminary design principles describe the first insight into the design of robotics-based learning environments.

AB  - The significance of incorporating ethics education in engineering programs has grown considerably in recent times, especially within domains such as computer science, software engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. In response to this demand, a pedagogical activity was developed and executed to facilitate students in applying ethical theories to occupational and societal challenges while enhancing their critical thinking abilities. This activity involves students participating in a debate where they are assigned a moral stance to uphold and must utilize one of the ethical theories explored in class to bolster their case. This paper offers an in-depth account of the conception and execution of this educational activity, as well as the encouraging results observed. Furthermore, the paper showcases the scenario utilized in the activity, which outlines a professional conundrum in the realm of Computer Engineering. The findings of this educational activity indicate its efficacy as a teaching instrument for ethics in engineering programs, with potential applicability to other engineering fields. By integrating such pedagogical activities into engineering programs, educators can empower students with essential ethical values and skills to tackle intricate ethical issues in their professional and social spheres while also fostering critical thinking and encouraging dialogue among students.

AB  - This complete work on innovative practices presents a proposal for a framework applied in an engineering discipline based on hybrid teaching and active methodologies, carefully planned to allow students to contextualize their essential content added to the social impact of their profession. This proposal seeks to guarantee the possibility of assimilating learning between lines and between years of study, guaranteeing connectivity between the teaching teams of the interdisciplinary faculty, between the lines of the curriculum, and between students, inside and outside their formal studies and the classroom. In this way, we provide not only the development of technical skills but also contemplate one of the significant challenges in engineering education, which is the development of socially relevant engineering curricula, thus strengthening the intrinsic motivation and adaptability of the student. In the face of the ongoing transformations in the engineering field - especially considering the rise of Industry 4.0 - professionals in this area must get an inter and trans disciplinary education, in close touch with society and industry needs. This calls for educational practices that stimulate entrepreneur development, dynamical skills, and traditional technical knowledge. In this work, we propose the 4D CV framework based on hybrid teaching and new trends in teaching and learning based on active methodologies, seeking to train a future professional who acts as an active agent in society, capable of facing the challenges of Engineering in the 21st century. We create learning environments that allow for (i) the development of capacity and motivation for teamwork in a technical, multi, and interdisciplinary way; (ii) a creative environment aiming for a comprehensive education along with entrepreneurial spirit and ability to innovate; (iii) reflection and discussion that favor independent critical thinking; (iv) actions that strengthen the university's relationship with the local community allowing closer relation with society and the productive sector. The proposed framework was the subject of a case study applied in the discipline of Curricular Integration Activities IV, of the undergraduate course in Automation Engineering of a Federal University of Brazil, where the technique of the Discourse of the Collective Subject (DCS) to capture the impression of those involved in the study (students, teachers and partner companies). It was possible that the practices of the proposed curriculum project could provide students with inter and multidisciplinarity in their learning process. In addition, students have been motivated in the face of involvement with the needs of society, achieved through practice in an innovative project in which the challenge was based on the real pains/demands/needs of a real startup company, formed by graduates of the course itself, already established in the market. We can thus conclude not only the tremendous innovative potential of our curricular proposal in the face of the significant challenges in engineering education but also its innovative character in approaches to higher education in Brazil.

AB  - This paper focuses on the computational identification of characters in fictional narratives, regardless of their nature, i.e., either humans, animals or other type of beings. We approach this problem as a supervised binary classification task, whether or not a noun in a narrative -specifically in a fairy taleis classified as a character. A wide range of Machine Learning algorithms and configurations were tested in order to come up with the most appropriate model (or set of models) to successfully fulfil this task. Despite the challenges associated with the character identification in the domain of children stories, the best models obtain an F-Measure above 0.80, proving a good performance and broadly outperforming the baselines.

AB  - Intelligence in engineering systems is expected to gain much more attention during the next years than presently because making interdependent decisions along contextual chains by an engineer increasingly requires reproduction of earlier decisions by other engineers. While a single decision on an object parameter or parameter group in a product structure may be influenced by several humans, humans are strictly responsible for their decisions. The only way is development of transparent intelligent engineering procedures those are capable for representation of humans. The above features of engineering tasks do not allow application of closed procedures from the conventional knowledge engineering and computational intelligence. The authors are engaged in application of knowledge based methods in intelligent engineering. This paper starts with purposeful characterizing of intelligent engineering features in current industrial product modeling systems. Following this, it discusses possibilities for adding intelligence to current product modeling processes. An earlier proposed method by the authors in modeling of human intent driven engineering objectives and contextual connections as entities to assist decisions is applied. Finally, the authors propose a possible way to capture human thinking process element in order to establish intelligent content in product models. The starting point of the proposed modeling is current modeling functionality of industrial product lifecycle management systems widely applied in aircraft, car, house appliance and other industries.

CICT new awareness of a discrete HG (hyperbolic geometry) subspace (reciprocal space, RS) of coded heterogeneous hyperbolic structures, underlying the familiar Q Euclidean (direct space, DS) system surface representation can open the way to holographic information geometry (HIG) to recover lost coherence information in system description and to develop advanced quantum cognitive systems. This paper is a relevant contribution towards an effective and convenient “Science 2.0” universal computational framework to achieve deeper cognitive intelligence at your fingertips and beyond.

AB  - A generally intelligent cognitive machine is deliberative, reflective, adaptive, empathetic and rational; continually aiming for the best responses to complex real-world events. This article describes our efforts towards the realization of such a machine – an embodied machine-mind – endowed with abilities of multisensory processing, commonsense reasoning, reflection, consciousness, and empathy. A procedure for contemplation and comprehension by the machine-mind has been formalized. It uses: a) Z*-numbers for active-thought abstraction, b) multisensory data-structures to encapsulate objective and subjective real-time inputs, and transport these across framework-modules, and c) dynamic action-descriptor formulations for bespoke behavior, perception, and real-time attention modulation. The defined procedure acknowledges the machine-mind's interest in the subject being comprehended, and covers different levels of thinking (instinctive reactions to self-consciousness reasoning). This investigation contributes to the synthesis of ‘thinking machines’ for man-machine symbiosis.

AB  - Contribution: This paper provides evidence that computational creativity exercises (CCEs) can increase engineering students' learning in introductory computer science (CS1) courses. Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students' learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics.

AB  - In this paper we describe the results of a rigorous empirical study evaluating the coping responses of a computational model of emotion. We discuss three key kinds of coping, Wishful Thinking, Resignation and Distancing that impact an agent's beliefs, intentions and desires, and compare these coping responses to related work in the attitude change literature. We discuss the EMA computational model of emotion and identify several hypotheses it makes concerning these coping processes. We assess these hypotheses against the behavior of human subjects playing a competitive board game, using monetary gains and losses to induce emotion and coping. Subject's appraisals, emotional state and coping responses were indexed at key points throughout a game, revealing a pattern of subject's al-tering their beliefs, desires and intentions as the game unfolds. The results clearly support several of the hypotheses on coping responses but also identify (a) extensions to how EMA models Wishful Thinking as well as (b) individual differences in subject's coping responses.

AB  - This experience report paper reports on case studies of final exams that used creative problem solving to assess students’ ability to apply the material, and divergent thinking to ensure that each student’s exam was unique. We report on two senior-level software engineering courses, taught a total of six times across three semesters. The paper gives enough information for readers to adapt this method in their own courses. Our exams include built-in divergence properties, which are elements or decisions that lead students to more than one good answer. Based on our experience, divergent thinking, creative problem solving exams not only provide excellent assessments of student knowledge, but ensure the integrity of the exam process, even when students work without supervision. We developed this strategy during the pandemic when all courses were online, but find them to be better than our traditional exams and are now using this strategy for in-person courses.

AB  - Comprehensive theories of conflict in the cyber world have not yet been developed, but the utilization of traditional military strategy and operational concepts in lieu of existing strategies in this realm can mislead, resulting in spurious assessments and unfavorable outcomes. Four tenets of the cyber world present profound challenges for the application of traditional military strategies in cyber conflicts. The cyber world is characterized by the following: 1) a lack of object permanence, which undermines the concept of maneuver; 2) limited or absent measurement of effectiveness in offensive cyber; 3) conflicts that are executed at computational speed, thus removing the time window for meaningful strategic leadership; and 4) anonymity, which makes the parties to the conflict unknown. As a result, the use of traditional military thinking and path-dependent behavior in cyber is likely to lead to incorrect conclusions regarding strategic achievements and abilities in the pre-conflict stage, and increase the risk of strategic failure during conflict and provide an opportunity for an adversary's strategic surprise.

It is supposed that designers apply such approach, beginning with a root task of an innovative project of a system with software in conditions, in which used words acquire the sense in reasoning which helps to build the statement of this task. In this case, the suggested version of ontological support helps to create and use the project ontology in parallel with the reasoning in their coordinated applying with other mechanisms of design thinking. Such intertwined process leads to the controlled use of the chosen lexicon, timely discovering the semantic errors and achieving the necessary understanding of its managerial potential.

AB  - This paper focuses on explicit considering of motives and goals at the stage of design thinking when designers try to understand the system to be designed as a wholeness. For this, it is advisable to apply the architecture approach, developing an initial complex of the essential views of the corresponding architectural description. The complex must not only provide an initial understanding of the future system but also demonstrates the conditions under which the intended goals will be attained. We propose a version of creating the complex by solving the systems of conceptual equations, any of which corresponds to the cause-and-effect discourse of an abductive kind. The version is realized in the instrumental environment that supports automated design thinking.

AB  - Recent technological advancements are revolutionizing the field of pathology as the practice adopts digital workflows and computational tools to augment the analysis of tissue and enhance its role in patient care. These advancements are poised to make a particularly significant impact in low-income and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by worsening pathology service shortages and rising cancer rates. Courses targeted towards undergraduate students interested in this emergent field of computational pathology (CPATH) are required to prepare the next generation of innovators and leaders in this space. However, such training courses have mostly been lacking and their design presents with several challenges. CPATH exists at the intersection of multiple complex specialties and so, following a traditional bottom-up curriculum, courses are often limited to the graduate level. In addition, standard didactic courses struggle to keep with the rapid pace of advancements driving the field, build the essential multidisciplinary teamwork skills, train the technical skillsets required for success, or emphasize innovation. Structured experiential learning (EL) has a long track record of success in addressing these issues and presents as a natural modality for early CPATH education. We have designed and piloted a project based EL course targeted towards undergraduates to address these limitations in CPATH education. At the core of the course experience, students work together to conceptualize, design, and implement innovative solutions to leverage CPATH towards addressing global health inequity. Here we present our design of the course, review insights from our first two years of piloting this course and share plans for course improvement drawn from these insights.Clinical relevance— CPATH is making a significant impact on the practice of pathology and is poised to play a major role in addressing global health inequities. This course is designed to prepare undergraduate and graduate students to innovate in this rapidly growing and developing field as members of multidisciplinary teams through structured project based EL. While open to students at the undergraduate and master’s level from all backgrounds, it is directed at undergraduate biomedical engineering, computer science, and pre medicine students who are interested in future careers in this field.

AB  - The prerequisite knowledge regarding Computer Science (CS) varies strongly among freshmen at university and it seems advisable to compensate for these differences before the first lecture starts. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) might represent a possible solution. We therefore designed and developed a MOOC (called “LOOP: Learning Object-Oriented Programming”) which provides a gentle introduction to computational thinking and object-oriented concepts before the programming part. In addition to the common quizzes, we developed various we-based interactive exercises to enable the learners to experiment and interact directly with the presented concepts. Furthermore, we implemented programming exercises with constructive feedback for the learners using a web-based integrated development environment and additionally an automatic grading system. The target group of the course are prospective students of science or engineering that are due to attend CS lessons in their first terms. The course was conducted as a prototype with a limited number of participants. In a concluding survey, the participants submitted textual feedback on the course; some of them proposed specific improvements for the employed interactive exercises. Yet, the overall feedback was encouragingly positive. In this paper, we describe the design and the development of the course, as well as our initial results.

This lightning talk delves into a virtual reality education and entertainment application named Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). Our in vivo study examines how VEnvI can be used to teach fundamental computer science concepts such as sequences, loops, variables, conditionals, functions, and parallel programming. We aim to reach younger students through a fun and intuitive interface for choreographing dance movements with a virtual character. Our study contrasts the highly immersive and embodied virtual reality metaphor of using VEnvI with a non-immersive desktop metaphor. Additionally, we examine the effects of user attachment by comparing the learning results gained with customizable virtual characters in contrast with character presets. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative user responses measuring cognition, presence, usability, and satisfaction, we hope to find how virtual reality can enhance interest in the field of computer science among middle school students.

AB  - The increasing societal dependence on software, and the negative consequences of undesirable behavior of software, calls for ever more attention to software quality. The purpose of software quality control is activities that support the achievement of desirable levels of software quality, and software testing is one such activity. In order to preserve the intent of software testing, it must be deliberated carefully, and given necessary time and due diligence, before being acted upon. In that regard, this paper adopts a human-centered approach to software testing, embraces mind mapping as a lightweight technique for early software testing-related commitments, provides elements of a theoretical basis for mind mapping, and offers a guided tour of software testing-related mind maps using practical examples relevant in academia as well as industry.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel computational approach for stimulating creativity of designers. The tree structured genetic algorithm is used for generating 2D sketch shapes and 3D images. This approach is illustrated by an artwork design example, which uses general mathematical expressions to form 2D sketch shapes for artistic flower vases and the combination of general and complex function expressions to form 3D images of artistic flowers. It shows that approach is able to generate some solutions for supporting creative thinking of designers.

AB  - The increased push for access to computer science (CS) at the K-12 level has been argued as a way to broaden participation in computing. At the elementary level, computational thinking (CT) has been used as a framework for bringing CS ideas into the classroom and educating teachers about how they can integrate CT into their daily instruction. A number of these projects have made equity a central goal of their work by working in schools with diverse racial, linguistic, and economic diversity. However, we know little about whether and how teachers equitably engage students in CT during their classroom instruction-particularly during science and math lessons. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing classroom instructional videos using the EQUIP tool (https://www.equip.ninja/). The purpose of this tool is to examine the quantity and quality of students' contributions during CT-integrated math and science lessons and how it differs based on demographic markers. We highlight this approach using classroom video observation from four teachers and discuss future work in this area.

So, by following the guidelines of dialectic and the cultural-historical activity theory, an alternative contradictions-based meanings qualitative model is proposed. Apart from the mainstream connectionist and mechanistic mainstream, aesthetics -as consciousness in general- is considered the empirical manifestation in practice to satisfy the human’s needs and the representation/answer of human perturbations. Moreover, this paper attempts to introduce a formalized version of art therapy.

AB  - Meta-synthesis approach (MSA) proposed by Prof. Qian is an oriental system methodology for complex problem solving. The essential idea of MSA can be simplified as "confident hypothesizing, rigorous validating", i.e. quantitative knowledge arises from qualitative understanding. Accordingly, creative thinking as a useful and practical technique for complex problem solving, is the unity of divergent thinking and convergent thinking which appear alternatively in the whole creative process of human thinking. In this paper, a computational scheme based on MSA is applied to solve the complex problems. Firstly, group argumentation environment (GAE) as a computerized tool is used to facilitate expert divergent thinking process (meeting) on the concerned topics and form scenario or hypotheses based on qualitative MSA. Then, a quantitative evaluation model had been building to analyze the centralization of the different scenarios, which can used to measure the efficient of different argumentation scenario.

AB  - With the proposal of quality-oriented education, Scratch programming teaching in elementary schools is of great importance to the growth and development of students. The visual interface, building block programming, and easy-to-use features of Scratch are suitable for teaching elementary school students, which can also better cultivate students’ analytical problem-solving skills and enhance their logical thinking. However, only a part of schools and students are currently learning this programming, and it is not popular enough yet. Moreover, if the teaching is mainly based on the teacher’s explanation, it will be boring. Therefore, there is a need to explore the teaching based on game design and combine teaching with fun, so that learning can become a more acceptable “game” for students, making the classroom atmosphere more active and improving the teaching quality of the classroom.

AB  - Almost all current matchmaking systems for team competition games based on player skill ratings contain algorithms designed to create teams consisting of players at similar skill levels. However, these systems overlook the important factor of playing style. In this paper, we analyze how playing style affects enjoyment in team competition games, using a mix of Sternberg's thinking style theory and individual histories in the form of statistics from previous matches to categorize League of Legend (LoL) players. Data for approximately 64 000 matches involving 185 000 players were taken from the LoLBase website. Match enjoyment was considered low when games lasted for 26 min or less (the earliest possible surrender time). Results from statistical analyses indicate that players with certain playing styles were more likely to enhance both game enjoyment and team strength. We also used a neural network model to test the usefulness of playing style information in predicting match quality. It is our hope that these results will support the establishment of more efficient matchmaking systems.

AB  - The authors introduce a new method for the establishment of an extension to current product models in order to enhanced communication between human and modeling processes. The main contribution of the reported work to product modeling is a dialogue input and model representation of human intent in order to make assistance for human who applies product model and needs important details from thinking process of human whom decision must be considered. The proposed method enforces human intent based definition of engineering objects. In order to achieve this, human intent representation is used at definition of engineering objectives for definition of engineering objects while contextual connections amongst intents, objectives and decisions, and amongst these entities and engineering objects are also considered. Consequences of changes of engineering objects are tracked along change chains in the change affect zones of the changed engineering objects. This modeling constitutes a new extension to classical product modeling and is placed between the human and the current information based product model in order to establish an efficient and coordinated control of engineering object parameters.

AB  - Use of archival collections is accelerated by the presence of finding aids, which communicate the arrangement and description of collection contents. To arrive at the optimal arrangement of a collection, archivists rely on some item-level processing or knowledge gained by exploring and manipulating digital reproductions of the contents. In this paper we consider archival student and instructor perspectives from hands-on course experiences directly with two distinct collections: one pertaining to the development, 2017 transfer and launch, and ongoing maintenance of the International Research Portal for Records Related to Nazi-Era Cultural Property (IRP2), and one a selection of unclassified catalog entries about digitized nuclear science reports. Visualizing is a data practice that permits the discovery of key content patterns, identification of computational models to be carried out to aid further analysis, and query-resolution for subject experts with precise - and historically significant - research questions. While archival data visualizations have previously been implemented as an extension of descriptive work including finding aid element counts, here we connect visualization to the work of archival outreach and access. We study how visualizations generated by groups of students working with textual and numerical dataset portions can ultimately accelerate time-sensitive uses of collections.

AB  - The article reveals the main provisions of the development of a methodology for determining the level of political socialization of modern youth. The analysis of the available foreign and domestic interpretations of the concept of “political socialization” is carried out. The author's understanding of the political socialization of the individual is substantiated. The structural components of the political socialization of youth are highlighted, taking into account the age stage. The period of secondary socialization allowed the authors to identify four blocks - components of political socialization, which formed the basis of the questionnaire. Automation of the process of presenting the methodology and processing the survey data allows the respondent to get an idea of their own level of political socialization, and developers to route the individual - the need to eliminate gaps in political socialization by recommending the passage of certain correctional and developmental activities through the information and educational platform model being created in the future. The testing of the automated version of the methodology has shown its effectiveness in quickly and correctly determining the level of political socialization of young people. The technique can be used for both individual and group work.

AB  - Granular computing is a computation theory that imitates human thinking and reasoning by dealing with information at different levels of abstraction/precision. The adoption of granular computing approach in the design of data classification systems improves their performance in dealing with data uncertainty and facilitates handling large volumes of data. In this paper, a new approach for the design of medical data classification systems is proposed. The proposed approach makes use of data granulation in training the classifier. Training data is granulated at different levels and data from each level is used for constructing the classification system. To evaluate performance of the proposed approach, a classification system based on neural network is implemented. Four medical datasets are used to compare performance of the proposed approach to other classifiers: neural network classifier, ANFIS classifier and SVM classifier. Results show that the proposed approach improves classification performance of neural network classifier and produces better accuracy and area under curve than other classifiers for most of the datasets used.

AB  - In many introductory programming courses, the surface features of the programming language can distract and intimidate students so much that they fail to concentrate on what is really the ldquobrainyrdquo task: solving the problem conceptually. To counter this, we devised a form of structured pseudocode, designed to highlight and facilitate algorithmic construction so that the complexities of the programming language can be deferred until proficiency in design has been reached. Students taught with this experimental approach are not introduced to the language itself, or the compiler, until the last few weeks of the semester. A controlled experiment comparing this approach with a traditional language-based pedagogy has revealed that by the end of the course, studentspsila programming skills, even on language-specific tasks, is every bit as strong as students taught traditionally, and that their comfort level with modularity (writing functions) is increased. Additionally, we found that students appear to strongly prefer such an approach, citing mostly emotive benefits, and that these effects may be particularly strong among women.

Governments and institutions around the world are working on the challenges posed by AI in all aspects, from economy to education. Therefore, introducing AI-related content at school and exploring how this kind of content can be taught becomes mandatory. In this paper we carry out a bibliographic revision of previous works done on ML, and then describe an educational resource developed by the institution of the first two authors (INTEF) aimed to teach ML in schools with Scratch and Machine Learning for Kids. The testimonials of three educators, who have implemented their own version of these resources, are depicted. More efforts should be made to introduce AI-related content in education.

AB  - In this global economy, the preparation of a globally competitive U.S. workforce with knowledge and understanding of critical computing concepts is essential. Our CPACE (Collaborative Process to Align Computing Education with Engineering Workforce Needs) vision is to revitalize undergraduate computing education within the engineering and technology fields. Our objective is to design and implement a process to engage stakeholders from multiple sectors and identify the computational tools and problem-solving skills and define how these skills-directly informed by industry needs-can be integrated across disciplinary curricula. By explicitly integrating computing concepts and disciplinary problem solving, engineering graduates will enter the workforce with improved and practice-ready computational thinking that will enhance their problem-solving and design skills. We present the analysis of the computational skills and the strategies that we are using to map the workforce problem-solving requirements onto the foundational computer science principles. We outline the framework that we are using to identify opportunities for curricular integration between computer science concepts and the disciplinary engineering curricula. By documenting, evaluating, and making the process explicit, this process can serve as a model for national efforts to strengthen undergraduate computing education in engineering.

AB  - The growing number of phishing attacks is one of the top concerns of cybersecurity researchers. Cryptographic methods are not reliable in stopping phishing attacks because they manipulate the users into thinking it is safe to access a web link. This results in compromise of sensitive information. Recent research has shown how machine learning methods are capable of detecting malicious websites. However, machine learning models can be computationally heavy to produce good accuracy. This paper focuses on reducing the computational cost while maintaining an effective prediction model. The experiment is conducted on a dataset of size (30, 10000), consisting of phishing and benign website links. The Isomap algorithm is implemented to reduce the input dimension while preserving correlation. Subsequently, a neural network is employed, utilizing simple activation and optimization functions to ensure efficient and rapid prediction. The model achieves an accuracy of 87% under 30 training epochs.

AB  - Modern mathematics careers are now requiring conceptual skills such as, critical thinking, modeling, and application of the content. This change in skillset needed for careers has strongly impacted mathematics curriculum and assessment. Meaningful assessment involves examining students' ability to inquire, to reason on targeted questions or tasks, and to promote conceptual understanding, not just focusing on discreet facts and principles. Mathematics assessment tools still focus solely on this procedural side of understanding mathematics instead of the equally important conceptual aspect of learning mathematics. Given that math is an active process that encourages higher-order thinking and problem solving, an assessment focusing on the growth of conceptual understanding is required. The proposed research focuses on the development of a tool that will be used to assess current U.S. calculus students' ability to apply their conceptual understanding of a mathematic concept to scientific phenomena through modeling. The assessment using Netlogo would be very useful for math educators to have good tools to assess students' conceptual understanding, as well as to develop instructional strategies used.

AB  - We are using COMSOL Multiphysicstrade, a commercial finite element modeling software package, to develop simulations of equipment in our unit operations laboratory including a heat exchanger, a gas permeation membrane, and a fluid flow experiment. Our hypothesis is that computer simulations showing the solutions to the differential equations that govern the fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer within the equipment will solidify the link between experiment and theory and provide improved learning. Students in one lab section who used the simulations were compared to those in a control section who did not. A diagnostic quiz given before and after each lab provided a quantitative measure of improvement in learning via the lab experience for both groups. Content analysis of written and oral reports was used to measure any difference in higher level thinking demonstrated by the two groups. Student attitudes towards the simulations were assessed by surveys and end-of-course evaluations. Results so far, in the second year of a three-year project, indicate improvements in student satisfaction and learning but little change in critical thinking that can be attributed to the simulations.

AB  - Nowadays, people, things, and processes are all connected to internet, and Internet of Everything (IoE) is addressing them conjointly. It is expected that these entities of IoE will communicate to one another, and produce a huge amount of invaluable data, thus generating a need to understand this kind of data. Computational approaches have shown their capabilities in extracting valuable information from such data. Usually these techniques focus on determining concrete concepts (particular activities such as driving, sitting, or entities like digit `1', `2' etc.). On the contrary, abstract concept identification (actions such as Motion-state, Static-state, or entity like `Number') is relatively less explored. In this article we present a methodology to model abstract representation of concepts without supervision, along with a mechanism to utilize generated models in an artificial system. Primarily, we illustrate a Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) approach that identifies abstract concepts, and dynamically builds a hierarchy to represent them. Further, we describe RANs learning, a novel way of associating concepts in two subsequent layers. We experimentally demonstrate how our approach is unsupervised, and able to model abstract activity (static-state and motion-state) of the subjects, using the Smart-phones Dataset from UCI machine learning repository for Human Activity Recognition problem.

AB  - Logic Programming allows for the exploration and development of Computational Thinking skills. Those being abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, and generalisation, among others, which are fundamental for problem-solving. What is more, Logic Programming helps building up Logical Thinking skills, also distinguishing valid arguments from fallacies and contradictions, as well as establishing connections between arguments through reasoning, to name some. These practices are not only essential for the development of knowledge in STEM, but also in Computer Science disciplines. Recently, arguments have been standing in favour of the early integration of programming within compulsory education. The international scientific community is looking forward to researching and initiatives being deployed towards this direction. This article introduces Metagame -Metajuego-, a methodological proposal which integrates key aspects to facilitate the effective integration of Logic Programming in primary education through collaborative and gamifying strategies. Furthermore, concrete cases of games are presented which have been formulated thanks to applying the proposed methodological approach to different educational contexts. The narratives upon which these games are based, incorporate learning cores presented in the curricular school designs where they were implemented.

AB  - We present an empirical evaluation of immersion and self-avatars as compared to desktop viewing in Virtual Reality (VR) for learning computer programming and computational thinking in middle school education using an educational VR simulation. Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences.

AB  - Reasoning about programs is an important component of computational thinking. Laws of computation give meaning to the formalisms in which programs are expressed, and can be used to predict or explain program behavior, or to uncover bugs. This paper presents Calypso, a language inspired by Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab but designed for programming actual mobile robots rather than characters in a virtual world. The initial implementation of Calypso uses the Cozmo robot by Anki. Like Kodu, the Calypso interpreter can be described by five key laws. An understanding of the laws and how to apply them constitutes a mental model of computation. Calypso provides a variety of affordances and scaffolding techniques to foster development of effective mental models and facilitate computational thinking.

AB  - During the last two decades educational robotics became a popular tool for teaching STEM concepts to audiences of all levels. Yet, its use for teaching programming with university-level non-STEM audiences has not been researched so far. This work presents a new educational activity designed for teaching programming to non-STEM university-level audiences. The key aspect is a separation of teaching programming concepts and programming language and; therefore, complexity reduction in learning. The concepts are introduced using educational robotics and later on students learn how to use the concepts in the context of the Python programming language. Two teaching approaches, direct instruction and productive failure, along with a capstone challenge are deployed and their relationship to educational robotics is observed.

These experiences have directly informed a significant redesign of a junior/senior undergraduate course, Introduction to High-Performance Computing (CS 4225 at Georgia Tech), which we are implementing for the current Spring 2012 semester. Based on feedback from the graduate version, the redesign of the undergraduate course emphasizes peer instruction and hands-on activities during the traditional lecture periods, as well as significant time for end-to-end projects. This paper summarizes our anecdotal findings from the graduate version's exit surveys and briefly outlines our plans for the undergraduate course.

AB  - Recent studies of creative cognition have revealed interactions between functional brain networks involved in the generation of novel ideas; however, the neural basis of creativity is highly complex and presents a great challenge in the field of cognitive neuroscience, partly because of ambiguity around how to assess creativity. We applied a novel computational method of verbal creativity assessment—semantic distance—and performed weighted degree functional connectivity analyses to explore how individual differences in assembly of resting-state networks are associated with this objective creativity assessment. To measure creative performance, a sample of healthy adults (n = 175) completed a battery of divergent thinking (DT) tasks, in which they were asked to think of unusual uses for everyday objects. Computational semantic models were applied to calculate the semantic distance between objects and responses to obtain an objective measure of DT performance. All participants underwent resting-state imaging, from which we computed voxel-wise connectivity matrices between all gray matter voxels. A linear regression analysis was applied between DT and weighted degree of the connectivity matrices. Our analysis revealed a significant connectivity decrease in the visual-temporal and parietal regions, in relation to increased levels of DT. Link-level analyses showed higher local connectivity within visual regions was associated with lower DT, whereas projections from the precuneus to the right inferior occipital and temporal cortex were positively associated with DT. Our results demonstrate differential patterns of resting-state connectivity associated with individual creative thinking ability, extending past work using a new application to automatically assess creativity via semantic distance.

AB  - Cultivating students’ ability to use emerging technologies for innovation is important for the reform of new business education. Technological change needs the thinking revolution essentially so the big data system is of great significance for the construction of talent training programs, implementation of competency requirements, and curriculum teaching design. This study was carried out to identify the main enablers of the big data computation (BTC) in improving the innovation capability of students majoring in business and developing a model based on the contextual relationship among the identified enablers. Initially, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the enablers of BTC. Then, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) was used to evolve mutual relationships among the identified 17 enablers for developing a hierarchical model. Five key driving enablers, namely data consciousness, system thinking, statistical thinking, model thinking, and analytical thinking were identified as main enablers. Image thinking played an important role in the process of data analysis and application. Suggestions were made to cultivate the student’s BTC from the following three aspects: adding system science courses in the big data specialty, increasing training opportunities for students in using tools and methods of big data management, and improving students' data literacy.

AB  - This Research to Practice Complete Work presents the category of Innovate Practice. Digital social grouping is now a common practice for exchanging any kind of data between group connections. However, this has posed some key issues for education professionals on the best path to the current educational system to fully embrace this practice and move on. [1] It suggests that “the school model as we know it is over. It makes no sense to students, does not produce expected results, nor prepares the new generations for the challenges of contemporary life.” To fill this gap, an innovative teaching model emerged as an alternative approach centered on the student and reinforced by the pedagogical and technological infrastructures. This work presents a framework as a computational tool to build and provide custom educational interfaces based on the concept of persuasion to push users to the most relevant content (eg, direction). This structure is based on participatory elements from various disciplines that cross the fields of education, computational engineering and psychology. The proposed framework shows that user interactions explored from the persuasion, engagement, and content customization techniques take into account the skills, needs and interests make teaching more attractive and applicable.

AB  - Think-aloud protocols are widely used by user experience (UX) practitioners in usability testing to uncover issues in user interface design. It is often arduous to analyze large amounts of recorded think-aloud sessions and few UX practitioners have an opportunity to get a second perspective during their analysis due to time and resource constraints. Inspired by the recent research that shows subtle verbalization and speech patterns tend to occur when users encounter usability problems, we take the first step to design and evaluate an intelligent visual analytics tool that leverages such patterns to identify usability problem encounters and present them to UX practitioners to assist their analysis. We first conducted and recorded think-aloud sessions, and then extracted textual and acoustic features from the recordings and trained machine learning (ML) models to detect problem encounters. Next, we iteratively designed and developed a visual analytics tool, VisTA, which enables dynamic investigation of think-aloud sessions with a timeline visualization of ML predictions and input features. We conducted a between-subjects laboratory study to compare three conditions, i.e., VisTA, VisTASimple (no visualization of the ML's input features), and Baseline (no ML information at all), with 30 UX professionals. The findings show that UX professionals identified more problem encounters when using VisTA than Baseline by leveraging the problem visualization as an overview, anticipations, and anchors as well as the feature visualization as a means to understand what ML considers and omits. Our findings also provide insights into how they treated ML, dealt with (dis)agreement with ML, and reviewed the videos (i.e., play, pause, and rewind).

The flipped classroom model for the course is primarily classified into three stages: pre-class, in-class, and after-class. In the pre-class stage, teachers used online learning platform and MOOC course materials as a tool to help students make due preparation for classroom. In the in-class stage, teachers organized active learning activities featured by experiential learning and collaborative peer work. In the afterclass stage, teachers design practice-oriented and problem-based assignment for students to reflect on the learning content. Meanwhile, it is important for instructors to provide detailed instructions on how to learn with the learning materials prior to class and focus on cultivating students’ higher order thinking skills in the teaching and learning process.

AB  - Granular computing emerges as a new multi-disciplinary study and has received much attention in recent years. A conceptual framework is presented by extracting shared commonalities from many fields. The framework stresses multiple views and multiple levels of understanding in each view. It is argued that granular computing is more about a philosophical way of thinking and a practical methodology of problem solving. By effectively using levels of granularity, granular computing provides a systematic, natural way to analyze, understand, represent, and solve real world problems. With granular computing, one aims at structured thinking at the philosophical level, and structured problem solving at the practical level.

As a method, we learn the source code and comment pair by Encoder-Decoder translation model using LSTM, thereby generating comments of the source code that was the target of learning. Though, since it is difficult to increase the amount of learning data when generating comment for problem description, generated comments have some incorrect word for problem sentence. We use program problem sentence to generate comments for source code more suitable for users.

AB  - As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.

AB  - STEM learning from an early age is essential to confirm that students are prepared to meet the needs of the world they will inherit. Currently, there are incredible and inexpensive technologies to keep students engaged and passionate about their learning. A drone is a handson apparatus that could be incorporated in STEM for several learning applications such as class projects, experiments, and exploration. In this paper, the STEMcoding framework is designed for kids to learn coding using a drone and Scratch programming. This platform attempts to visualize their coding by drone while Scratch makes a gaming environment to enhance their programming using block-based learning. The platform has applied in a STEM event at the University of Wisconsin Platteville and the results show the benefit of utilizing drone in STEM-coding as follows: i) transforms abstract concepts into concrete learning, ii) delivers an entertaining and motivating learning environment, iii) combines STEM theory with practice, and iv) provides a hand-on skill which is dynamic and attractive.

AB  - Learning is a life long process and the understanding gained depends on the extent of practice and effort from the learner. Learning process involves the cognitive ability to grasp and process the information in order to utilize the knowledge effectively. In science education, use of laboratories to supplement learning is integral to overall development of the learner. However, due to numerous challenges such as the lack of effectiveness of practical laboratories to impart conceptual knowledge, the learning goals are compromised. In this work, learning curves are modeled to quantitatively assess the extent of learning using a technology rich Virtual Laboratory platform to teach laboratory experimentation. Two specific skills i.e. thinking skills and design skills were characterized in the assessments. Significant improvements were observed not only in the scores but also the response speed demonstrated by students to complete the assessment.

This exposes the tradeoff between profit level of network operators and network price of Edge Users (EUs), which is captivated by both the operators and EUs, and allows the operator to handle an optimal economic specification design. We consider the problem of maximum profit with minimum network price problem (MPP) as optimization problem, and present heuristics to obtain the upgrade series optimally. Preliminary outcome presents that the proposed model increases the profit level by 20 % and reduces network price by 30% compared to general edge and cloud platform.

We propose a novel middleware that approaches GNN training from the perspective of a vertex-centric model (VCM) of distributed graph processing and overlays neural network training over it. Giraph Graph Neural Network (G2N2) uses a three-phase execution pattern by construction a distributed computation graph per mini-batch, and maps the forward and backward passes of the GNN training to VCM. We implement a prototype of G2N2 in Apache Giraph and report results from a preliminary evaluation using two real-world graphs on a commodity cluster.

AB  - The Virtual Cell modeling and simulation framework is the product of interdisciplinary research in biology that applies the diverse strengths and experiences of individuals from engineering, the physical sciences, the biological sciences, and mathematics. A key feature is the separation of layers (core technologies and abstractions) representing biological models, physical mechanisms, geometry, mathematical models and numerical methods. This reduces software complexity, allowing independent development and verification, but most importantly it clarifies the impact of modeling decisions, assumptions, and approximations. The result is a physically consistent, mathematically rigorous, spatial modeling and simulation framework for cell biology. The Virtual Cell has a rich, interactive user interface which connects to remote services providing scalable access to a modeling database and a large dedicated cluster for shared computation and storage. In addition to new modeling capabilities, future developments will emphasize data and tool interoperability, extensibility, and experimentally oriented model analysis tools

The problem of the previous study was to focus on the sound transforming into chladni's image patterns, which ignored the colours as more significant measurement in vision. The approach to filling the gap is standing by the creative computing approach, with the published brain colour response data, this research rebuilds the benchmark algorithm by combining the digital HSV (hue saturation brightness colour system in the computer) with the Chladni's Law and is supported by Ontology Philosophy. The result of this research proposes a novelty model to help achromatopsia to distinguish and to perceive the energy of different colours. Additionally, the design grounds on the filter-free sensor CMOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) sensor technology, this paper proposed a sensor design plan for future model applications.

Today's robots blindly follow orders that have been prepared in advance. In order to make further progress in the acceptance of robots on the factory floor and in new applications such as surgery or service, robots must be able to sense and reason about their environment. We need to devote research to reasoning about geometry and processes. We need better ways of acquiring models than laborious programming in CAD systems. We need methods to represent errors and plan recoveries. These capabilities will be necessary for the autonomous robots of tomorrow.

AB  - Style transfer has been proven to be effective in mitigating domain shift in clinical settings, enhancing the adaptability of pathology image models. However, existing methods assume that the texture of the entire image is domain-specific and irrelevant to class-specific representations. These methods enhance all regions with a single style, which can result in information loss. In this work, we propose CLAP (Cross-modality Local Augmentation for histoPathology), a data augmentation approach that enables cross-modality local manipulation for pathology images. Specifically, the combination of a text extractor network and a feature mapping network enables the integration of CLIP embeddings for style descriptions into editable latent spaces at a fine-grained level. This approach prevents the loss of regional information in whole-slide images, eliminates the need to painstakingly select directions in latent space, and enhances creativity style selection. Experimental results demonstrate that CLAP improves the regional accuracy of cross-modality editing and achieves state-of-the-art performance by enhancing generalization in histopathology classification tasks.

AB  - Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need for all students in primary and secondary education to learn computer science (CS) concepts and skills. Educational games hold significant potential to serve as a platform for CS education because they integrate engaging problem solving with effective pedagogical strategies. This potential is especially high for narrative-centered educational games that embed learning activities within rich interactive stories. In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students' game-based learning activities. Building on these findings, we discuss design implications for creating student-adaptive CS learning experiences in educational games that incorporate block-based programming enriched narrative-centered gameplay.

AB  - To enhance the application capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in conceptual design, this study explores how to achieve deep integration between LLM-based agents and concept generation methods using the chain-of-thought (CoT) technique and evaluates its feasibility. Using GPT-4 as a case study, we designed two agents: IntelliStorm (based on the unstructured brainstorming method) and EvoluTRIZ (based on the structured TRIZ method). Thirty participants were recruited, and through two experimental phases spaced one month apart, a comparative analysis of the effects of collaboration groups (human-agent vs. human-human) and concept generation methods (brainstorming vs. TRIZ) on participants’ physiological activation and creative thinking performance were conducted. The results show that the involvement of LLM-based agents can effectively reduce participants’ electrodermal activity(EDA) response levels, indicating a reduction in cognitive load. Moreover, participants maintained their distinct physiological patterns and performance advantages across different concept generation methods. For example, IntelliStorm, like brainstorming, evokes stronger responses to information stimuli, demonstrating superior thinking fluency; EvoluTRIZ, like the TRIZ, exhibits a higher frequency of information responses, showcasing enhanced thinking elaboration. However, originality tends to favor human-human collaboration. The findings confirm that integrating LLMs with traditional concept generation methods is an effective strategy made possible by combining CoT and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies. In the future, LLM-based agents are expected to achieve broader application in the design field by incorporating additional concept generation methods.

AB  - This study explores the full potential of burst photography, a method that captures brief moments in a flood of pictures. However, the beauty of these frames is typically obscured by undesired blemishes such as occlusions and reflections. We address these restrictions by combining deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and adaptive neural splines, which surpass traditional image fusion and reveal the hidden brilliance inside. Acting like skilled artisans, the adaptive neural splines deftly separate and reweave the image's fabric. Their subtle touch safeguards every strand of visual information, ensuring the final result is a harmonious tapestry of enhanced clarity and preserved detail. This harmonic connection reveals itself in a transforming process that combines many frames into a single, stunning tapestry. Shadows reveal their secrets, the previously opaque depths now shining with clarity. Occlusions and reflections evaporate, leaving just a spotless canvas on which the scene's genuine brightness shines. The result is a symphony of increased clarity, with minute details emerging from darkness and textures dancing with unparalleled sharpness. The power of this invention is not just theoretical. Extensive comparisons to cutting-edge approaches demonstrate its revolutionary influence. Our model outperforms others in retaining fine detail, improving overall clarity, and maintaining visual integrity. These breakthroughs not only push the frontiers of computational photography but also serve as a catalyst for future advances in image processing and analysis. This study shows that creative thinking unleashes the power of visuals. We use deep learning and adaptive splines to turn burst photographs into everlasting masterpieces that uncover hidden brilliance.

AB  - This Full Paper in the Research to Practice Category reports on an empirical empirical study in which novel educational tools and techniques were employed to teach fundamentals of problem decomposition - a cognitive task transcending disciplines. Within the discipline of computer science, problem decomposition is recognized as a foundational activity of software development. Factors that contribute to the complexity of this activity include: (1) recognizing patterns within an algorithm, (2) mapping the understanding of an algorithm to the syntax of a given programming language, and (3) complexity intrinsic to the problem domain itself. Cognitive load theory states that learning outcomes can be positively affected by reducing the extraneous cognitive load associated with learning objectives as well as by changing the nature of what is learned. In the study reported upon here, a novel instructional method was developed to decrease students' cognitive load. Novel instructional content supported by a custom visualization tool was used in a classroom setting in order to help novice programmers develop an understanding of function-based problem decomposition within the context of a visual domain. Performance on outcome measures (a quiz and assignment) were compared between the new method and the traditional teaching method demonstrated that students were significantly more successful at demonstrating mastery when using the new instructional method.

AB  - A grand challenge of the computer science (CS) for all education movement is the preparation of thousands of teachers with high-quality, accessible professional development (PD) that has evidence of improving teacher knowledge and pedagogical practices necessary to support the learning needs of diverse groups of students. While regional PD programs can provide in-person learning opportunities, geographic and time constraints often inhibit participation of teachers, particularly educators from less densely populated communities. This experience report shares findings from an online PD program modified from the existing in-person Exploring Computer Science (ECS) PD program to provide teachers a facilitated online learning community model to support their first year teaching the course. Using two years of data collected from pre-and post-PD surveys and course participation observations, this experience involved 152 teachers from 34 states and Washington, DC. The findings reveal how the development of a facilitated learning community model of professional development, heavily based on shared experience among participants, can increase CS teachers' confidence in adapting and delivering lessons that are designed to be engaging and accessible to all students. Findings also suggest that teachers highly valued the opportunity to authentically collaborate around their common computer science course with diverse instructors from all corners of the United States. As CS education expands, the instructional environment described in this report provides an exemplar for how an online professional learning community design can concurrently build the specialized content knowledge, inclusive belief systems, and pedagogical skills of CS teachers.

AB  - The paper delves into decision making with partial knowledge focused on students' behaviour in multiple-choice testing. To address to this problem, we first provided a binary knowledge model and, then, relaxing some assumptions, allowed for the more realistic framework of partial knowledge which, in turn, adds uncertainty to the assessment of students' knowledge due to their incentive to make a guess in multiple-choice testing. The aim of this paper is to propose a fuzzy assessment model formalised according to Reiter's Theory of Diagnosis to reduce this uncertainty and to draw a distinction between the level of students' ability and the degree of guessing. The provided assessment model was tested on modelled answers with respect to the knowledge frameworks and validated in a real-world context. The findings of this research present the fuzzy learning performance assessment model which may enable a teacher to estimate the level of partial knowledge and, thus, to specify a student's score as well as the results of computational experiments that confirm the validity of the theoretical outcomes.

AB  - Computational creativity is an emerging branch of artificial intelligence that places computers in the center of the creative process. Broadly, creativity involves a generative step to produce many ideas and a selective step to determine the ones that are the best. Many previous attempts at computational creativity, however, have not been able to achieve a valid selective step. This paper shows how bringing data sources from the creative domain and from hedonic psychophysics together with machine learning and data analytics techniques can overcome this shortcoming to yield a system that can produce novel and high-quality creative artifacts. To demonstrate our data-driven approach, we developed and deployed a computational creativity system for culinary recipes and menus, Chef Watson, which can operate either autonomously or semiautonomously with human interaction. We present the basic system architecture, data engineering, and algorithms that are involved. Experimental results demonstrate the system passes the test for creativity based on the consensual assessment technique, producing a novel and flavorful recipe. Large-scale deployments are also discussed.

AB  - A user's location is a sensitive data and can reveal private information about the user's health, habit and preferences. Due to privacy concerns, people may hesitate to share their locations and prohibit the growth of location-based services and analysis. The problem of protecting location privacy has been extensively studied in the literature. Sharing location data in sequence enable adversaries to apply privacy attacks by exploiting spatio-temporal constraints in road networks. In this paper, we identify a novel privacy attack that existing solutions cannot overcome for not considering upcoming sensitive locations in advance. We develop a technique to precompute the warning zone, i.e. the refined area where the disclosure of a user's actual location may enable adversaries to identify the user's sensitive locations in the future. Warning zones also enable users to reduce the frequency of not sharing locations for privacy reasons, and thereby improve the accuracy and utility of shared locations while guaranteeing the required level of location privacy of a user. Experiments using real datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in terms of privacy, data utility and computational overhead.

AB  - The authors discuss why the current conceptual base of project management research and practice continues to attract criticism since it does not adequately address the complexity that leads to software-project failure. To do so, the study explores systems thinking and artificial neural networks to shed light on complexity in software-project behavior using nonlinear functional relationships between critical success factors and project success to utilize their connectedness as an approach in order to create project-outcome prediction models. The artificial neural networks were used to create two project-outcome prediction models: one for a binary classification task to discriminate failed from successful projects using a multi-input-single-output configuration and one for a multi-task binary classification to discriminate success from failure in multiple project-success dimensions using a multi-input multi-output configuration. The results yielded high-performance values for a binary classification task, performed to predict overall project success, and slightly lower performance values for the multi-task binary classification, which was also performed to predict success in project-success dimensions. It was found that the nonlinear behavior of critical success factors may be used to create prediction models, by embedding equifinality and connectedness constructs that prove to be useful to understand projects as complex, multi-loop, and nonlinear systems. Further research is needed to investigate the causality between critical success factors in order to explore the possible propagation of critical success factors within a project system network and its implications on project success.

AB  - In this article, we examine a female-oriented, high school computing outreach program, FLAMES, consisting of an 8-week high school summer intern program run within a university computer science (CS) department. We focus on examining the effects of the program on students skills and affect towards computing. Much of the literature in CS outreach research examines summer camps, after-school programs, and other school-year events that often have a focus on only teaching students computing content. Our program is unique and socially relevant as students are trained to assist teachers with the development of Computational Thinking-Infused curricula for their classrooms. This paper presents the design of our program, an overview of the curriculum, and results including both student and teacher feedback. Results show that the program has benefited each of the parties involved, including its student participants, facilitators, and the teachers assisted by the participants. We share our lessons learned in order to help other CS departments develop similar broadening participation in computing programs.

AB  - Background: The diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of “layers of abstraction” guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.

Creativity, particularly within the realm of art and design, is commonly perceived as the ability to think beyond conventional boundaries. The study posited an alternative perspective by equating computational thinking with creative thinking. A total of forty-two kids from a high school in Kazakhstan were chosen as case studies for the topic of Art. The objective is to facilitate the integration of STEM education and art-based education.

AB  - The literature about teaching programming usually reputes its learning as a difficult task. Some of them studied different aspects aiming to identify the reasons behind the high failure rates, such as students' mathematics background and text comprehension. This study is focused on identifying which mathematical knowledge positively correlates with programming skills acquisition. We claim that mathematical concepts related to induction, inference and logical reasoning are among such knowledge. To confirm it we conducted a quasi-experiment with students who were enrolled at a first programming course (CS1). We analysed their mathematical knowledge through a test and gathered information on their difficulties and strategies used to overcome their programming difficulties. The data sample was too small to allow for strong assertions. However, the results indicates a possible correlation between mathematical abilities and programming potential. Also, students repute the logic of programming and teaching methodology as the main sources of difficulties. Furthermore, many of them prefer to ask their teachers or look at websites to tackle their difficulties.

AB  - The development of three-dimensional geometry problem-solving skills is important for engineering students and professionals. Acquiring these skills through traditional methods often presents challenges for students, mainly because the teaching material is presented in plain images with which students cannot interact to gain greater understanding. This paper describes the development of a computational tool designed to transform plain axonometric projection images into 3D models compatible with CAD design software. To achieve this, we have engineered deep learning models to accurately classify, locate, and identify geometric elements within axonometric images. Our experimental results highlight the enhanced performance of the Faster-RCNN model, which achieved an 81 % mean Average Precision (mAP) on test images. This tool can help engineering students to have a better learning experience, allowing them to interact with three-dimensional representations and significantly improve their spatial understanding.

AB  - The investigation (i.e. modelling, simulation, understanding and control) of complex adaptive systems is a problematic issue mainly due to the immaturity of systems scientific modelling paradigms. The apparent analogies between complex adaptive systems and production networks provide us the opportunity to formulate the latter one in terms of the first, and integrate the knowledge and way of thinking of the two fields. Through the application of agent based modelling and the development of a methodology, a unique way of thinking is presented that involves the formulation of natural concepts in terms of simulation models

AB  - Summary form only given. A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science were used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations on related activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational intelligence and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vague and empirical approach without the support of formal models and rigorous means. In order to fonnally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of t he brain are s ought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics, and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics. A wide range of applications of cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC and my laboratory such as, inter alia, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, and cognitive automobiles.

AB  - Introduction to programming is a traditional and compulsory course for first year Computer Science students. However, research in the field of computer science education has highlighted that many students lack on problem solving and computational thinking skills. These issues provoke questions in the academic community as to whether the learning methodology of introductory to programming courses is appropriate. As regards the pedagogical procedure in general, the teacher-centered model was amended with the introduction of Interactive Learning Environments, which promote distributed learning. In this paper, we examine the fundamental skills needed for introductory to programming courses. Additionally, we focus on some of the most popular micro worlds and evaluate them in terms of educational suitability.

AB  - The process of implementing coding at schools attended by pupils from six to fourteen years of age is a current trend in developed countries. In some cases, simple activities involving coding might be even included at kindergartens attended by children from three years of age. The crucial aim is to develop the so-called computational thinking which is going to be more and more essential for a successful personal and professional development of every individual. There is a broad range of factors influencing the success of the change in the curriculum, which is, inter alia, supposed to include coding. In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils. Insufficient knowledge is the key factor influencing teachers' negative attitudes towards the introduction of coding to schools.

AB  - Summary <p>This chapter details what is involved in Produce, the second stage of any Critical Systems Practice (CSP) intervention. Produce is concerned with the design of an appropriate intervention strategy based on the learning derived from Explore. It continues to carry forward the commitments of Critical Systems Thinking (CST) by selecting appropriate systems methodologies, models and methods that will later be used in a pluralist fashion to drive multifaceted improvement in a situation of interest. The success of Produce rests on understanding the purposes, strengths and weaknesses of different systems methodologies. Five types of systems methodology are identified and described &#x2013; engineering, system dynamics (SD), living, soft and emancipatory. These are shown to relate to the five systemic perspectives that were employed to provide an appreciation of the situation of interest in Explore. Examples are provided of how different methodologies were chosen as &#x2018;dominant&#x2019; at different times to steer interventions. Finally, some possible objections to what Produce suggests are discussed.</p>

AB  - Some complex problems in the computational area are learning programming and algorithms. Authoring system is a subject that can be considered as complex as it integrates the use of scripting language like Action Script in Flash, Active Server Pages (ASP) and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The normal problem that resides when it comes to programming is handling error as it is not an easy task and for those who are new, might find this very troublesome. Handling the error requires proper planning and skills in analyzing problem which students usually lack at. Reflection in learning is really helpful in helping students learn the Authoring System subject effectively as they are encourage to share ideas, experiences and perspective actively on the emerging issues of Action Script topic especially in discussing the concepts and errors. With the need for reflection in developing the required skills in learning Authoring System, how then do we ensure and measure the quality in student reflection journals and its contact in assessing the subject content and students' performance in learning? Quality is defined as "processes or outcomes" [1]. In the context of this research study, quality is determined by assessing the progression of reflective processes based on the interventions given. As an educator, we need to be aware on how new technologies act as the engagers and facilitators in the reflection purposes. Blog is one of the emerging technologies that can offer such pedagogical benefits as reflective tools and social affordances across disciplines provided that one can read and make comments that lead to meaningful discussion for common interests and individual differences [2]. Although blogging enable deep reflection in each individual blogs, somehow it failed to encourage peer feedback to each other blogs and collaboration among students to support reflective thinking as expected [3]. This problem exists probably due to the minimum used of blog technical features and also the absence of activities and guidelines to elevate collaborative reflection process to take place [4]. Students' familiarity with the blog technology cannot guarantee them with the skills to use it efficiently in educational setting. They still need further expose and training on how technologies can be used beyond the technological sake [4]. Besides the use of blogs, the design of the activities should not simply indicate the progress towards the solution of the problem if to allow reflective thinking to occur. The use of case-based learning can support reflective thinking among students in learning computer-based subject. However, the implementation of case-based learning requires the presence of an instructor to guide students to solve the subject matter at hand. Instructors are therefore encouraged to regulate students thinking by integrating the metacognitive strategies in learning necessary for academic success and students should also be granted with the opportunity in using this strategy to boost the likely for students to reflect on their task and therefore contributed to their experience as a community of learners. Unfortunately, many students failed to directly engage in metacognitive thinking unless they are shown ways to do so through prudently designed instructional activities. Thus, it is vital to embed metacognitive support in the design of learning environment especially when dealing with computer education subject which involves lots of technical aspects. This study believes that the integrations of several approaches as mentioned above can granted a green light in nurturing and achieving good quality in students' reflection. In this study, the quality is heavily relied on the use of feedback either from the instructors to students or among students themselves. Most of studies regarding the reflection done before only focusing on rating students' reflection journals all alone without considering other factors that may impacting certain levels of reflection. Therefore, this study is intended to identify the impact of provision of feedback in determining the quality of students' reflection and predicting the students' performance in learning Authoring System subject. This study will employ a quantitative research design which involves the use of pre-experimental design of one group pretest-posttest type. It will be conducted in one whole semester and will involve postgraduate students who registered for Authoring System subject. Three research instruments will be used in this study: questionnaires, performance test, and student's reflection in blogs. 1. Questionnaire: -There will be two questionnaires administered in this research study. The first questionnaire is about students' perceptions regarding the educational benefits of reflection through blogging while the second questionnaire is about the students' perceptions regarding the provision of feedback both from the peers and instructors. Both questionnaires are self-developed by the researchers and will be analyzed using the Rasch Model analysis technique which is run using Win steps software. By using Rasch Model, the findings will be more interesting and meaningful as from the students' psychometrics, researchers are able to dig into detail about the real relations between students and the measureable items. 2. Performance test: -The performance test is consists of several questions on Authoring System which cover the topic on Flash and Dreamweaver. It will be administered at the last session of the semester and is graded based on the answer scheme. The performance score will later be used in data mining analysis technique through Weka software in order to predict student's performance based on the pattern of reflection among students in learning the aforementioned subject. 3. Observations and analysis of students' reflections in blogs: -Throughout the semester, student's blogs will be monitored in order to observe their activities and to encourage them to do the reflection critically. Apart from the weekly reflections, several minicases activities will be posted in the instructor's blog and students are required to make critical reflections on each mini case. The minicase is designed to help students to apply concepts and suitable for practical in lab settings [5]. The cases will be created based on real-life practices and also from the problems encountered by the students while completing the class activities. Students' postings in the blogs will be analyzed via content analysis technique. The qualitative postings from the blogs which originally in the form of text will be coded using the four levels of reflective thinking framework by [6] and this action will transformed the qualitative data into quantitative data in terms of the frequency of occurrence. In order to measure the quality of reflection, the following analyses will be taken into account [7]: 1. Overall frequency of posting given by instructors and students. 2. Nature of posting by instructors and students (answers, questions, or mix of both). 3. Timing of the posting (during or end of forum). 4. How the postings style evolve from one level of reflective thinking to another as a result of provision of feedback by instructors and students. The general outcome of doing reflection is learning. However, this study is expected to achieve more than that. The upshot of this study will determine the quality in students' reflection and also the dominant level of reflective thinking. The outcome will further validate similar studies which previously conducted concerning the reflective thinking skills with the integration of technology, pedagogical aspects of learning for active involvement and how the students' psychometrics from the developed questionnaires can addressed the crucial information about the way students gain information and learning.

Two research questions were examined: (1) What are the opportunities and limitations for using computational methods and open source tools to characterize data encoded within records of enslavement and to discover new patterns and relationships in that data? (2) How does knowledge of social and cultural systems impact those opportunities and limitations? Computational methods and tools were most effectively used when socio-cultural contextualization and technology's role as a mediator of representation were taken into account. Three additional technical research areas are identified to enhance recovery of heritage hidden in records of enslavement: visualization, graph databases, and ontologies and metadata.

AB  - This innovative practice WIP paper describes how undergraduate students developed their curriculum development skills while designing an after-school program for learning computational thinking through writing. DEPICT (Discovering Computational Thinking through Creative Writing) is a pioneering project aimed at integrating computational thinking (CT) principles into high school (HS) creative writing (CW) classes. Developed by computer science (CS) undergraduate students, DEPICT for Out for School Time (DEPICT4OST) introduces a set of 16 innovative lessons designed to foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and algorithmic reasoning through the medium of CW. This WIP presents an exploration of the undergraduate experience in apprenticeship in the K12 outreach instructional space, crafting the DEPICT curriculum and the transformative journey of teaching others through the creation of engaging hands-on activities. Data was collected through pre- and post program surveys, classroom observations, and student work samples to assess the impact of the DEPICT program. The analysis involved comparing quantitative survey results, coding qualitative data from observations and students reflections, and evaluating changes in student work to determine the effectiveness of the program in achieving its educational goals. Drawing upon their expertise in CS and passion for creative expression, the undergraduate team embarked on the task of bridging the seemingly disparate domains of CT and CW. Through collaborative brainstorming sessions, iterative design processes, and pedagogical research, they developed a diverse range of lesson plans that seamlessly integrate computational concepts into writing prompts, narrative structures, and story-telling techniques. The practices of DEPICT4OST build upon a departmental emphasis on student ownership of outreach activity, which will be described in the paper. The paper explores the challenges of adapting complex computational concepts for HS students and aligning activities with educational standards. It also highlights the creative solutions the undergraduate team developed to make these abstract principles accessible and engaging through interactive writing exercises, group discussions, and multimedia presentations. Furthermore, the paper explores the pedagogical insights gained through the hands-on experience of teaching the DEPICT curriculum to HS students. The undergraduates reflect on their role as facilitators of learning, the impact of active learning techniques on student engagement, and the evolution of their teaching practices. By sharing anecdotes, student feedback, and reflections, the paper offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of infusing CT into CW education. In conclusion, DEPICT represents a pioneering initiative that harnesses the interactions between CT and creative expression to enrich HS education. The paper not only documents the development of the DEPICT curriculum but also underscores the transformative potential of collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches to education. Through the exploration of the under-graduate experience, it offers a roadmap for future endeavors seeking to innovate in the realm of STEAM education.

System 1 corresponds to a quick and intuitive estimation of propagation parameters such as path losses and angles of arrival/departure. System 2 is a more deliberate process that takes more time to ‘think’ and provides more accurate results. In this paper we describe the necessary components of a two-system propagation modeling framework, present initial results, and discuss the challenges.

AB  - It is recognized that the key theoretical and technical problems toward the next generation internet are not only a speed issue, but also a more fundamental issue of the increasingly demands for the sharing of computational intelligent capabilities. According to cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], the cognitive information that humans acquire, process, retain, and share can be classified into four profound forms known as knowledge, experience, skill, and wisdom. Among them, wisdom is the most advanced cognitive objects, which is a form of natural intelligence of humans that transfers a query or instruction into an action or behavior based on a well developed reasoning and judgment. However, the current Internet is still remains as an information network. Towards the development of next generation Internet as a wisdom network, the World Wide Wisdom (WWW+) network infrastructures and technologies are yet to be sough t on the basis of cognitive informatics and cognitive computers. In WWW+, each node is a cognitive computer (CC) [3, 9, 10, 15], which is a form of autonomous and intelligent computers that think, perceive, and learn. CC enables the simulation of machinable thought such as computational inferences, reasoning, and causality analyses by autonomous inferences and perceptions mimicking the mechanisms of the brain [3, 15]. The cognitive learning engine of a CC is an autonomous learning system that enables machines learn in natural languages and symbolic notations. The cognitive search engine of a CC is a machine-learning-based search system that results in cognitive knowledge acquisitions and manipulations. On the basis of the development of CCs, the next generation internet, WWW+, will be developed as a world-wide intelligent network for knowledge processing, autonomous learning, and machine-supported problem solving. The theoretical foundations for WWW+ and cognitive computing are cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], with underpinning contemporary denotational mathematics [6, 12], such as concept algebra [7], system algebra [17], realtime process algebra [4, 8], granular algebra [12], and visual semantic algebra [11]. Denotational mathematics provides a coherent set of powerful mathematical means and explicit expressive power for the design, modeling, and implementation of cognitive computers and WWW+, as that of Boolean algebra for conventional computing technologies. WWW+ extends the current information-search-based Internet to wisdom providing and intelligence services that mimic and simulate the brain in the largest scope of the cyberspace in which each node plays a role as an autonomous super neural cell. As that the conventional Internet provides a solution to the “to be” category of problems for information sharing based on searching technologies, the WWW+-based internet solves the advanced “to do” category of problems for wisdom and intelligence capability sharing based on cognitive computing technologies. WWW+ will be the largest scope of computational intelligence and the closest embodiment of the brain as interconnected constituent intelligent components. A wide range of applications of WWW+ and cognitive computers have been identified such as, inter alia, theories, methodologies, and infrastructures of collective intelligence, networks of computational intelligence, services providing networks, distributed agent networks, distributed cognitive sensor networks, and distributed remote control systems.

AB  - Trust based situation awareness represents the flow of information regarding a situation within a group of agents based on their mutual trust. Situation Awareness (SA) in general is regarded as basis for efficient group decision making while trust based situation awareness is of utmost importance in safety critical systems as the trust is a key factor that tend to affect the beliefs of agents that are collaborating in an environment. In this study an existing model of situation awareness is extended to incorporate mutual trust of the participating agents. The proposed model is analyzed using two different paradigms of computational modeling techniques namely Agent Based Modeling (ABM) and Population Based Modeling (PBM). Various experiments are conducted using variety of populations. Results show that with incorporation of trust factor, both approaches show similar patterns with large population size. In addition to that, relation between SA and trust is analyzed and the results show that SA gets affected by the inter-agent trust.

AB  - Music generation has been an active field of research in computer science and is considered as a creative task attempting to imitate human creativity. With the different approaches to generate musical content, recent works have focused on general adversarial networks. One of these is the Midinet, which is considered the baseline model in this study. In this paper, we propose our Next Bar Predictor, a generative model that creates melody one bar at a time using the previous bar as basis to generate aesthetically pleasing melodies. We explore several variants of this by experimenting on different regression and classification models such as Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were trained using the dataset from Theorytab which consists of 460 songs. The outputs of these different variant models were then compared against those from the Midinet, using both machine-based objective scoring mechanism as well as human-based subjective evaluations. The dissimilarity scores obtained by our KNN (0.65) and DT (0.74) models, scored against the melodies in the dataset, are sufficiently high and indicates that both models are generally creative. Furthermore, based on the evaluation by human listeners, the melodies generated by our DT models are more realistic and pleasing than those of the Midinet. Casual listeners also prefer the DT model to be more interesting, although professional listeners think otherwise. Finally, all the variant models, when compared with Midinet, require much less training time and computational power. The proposed Next Bar Predictor is therefore a viable alternative for automated music generation.

AB  - A study was carried out which examined the extent to which young people aged 11-12, with no prior instruction in programming, are able to write computational rules which govern play in a 3D computer role-playing game. Expressing these rules required the use of common computational structures such as conditionals, sets and loops. We analysed the rules written for their structure and style, and recorded the types of errors made. It was found that although young people were able to abstract away from the game play experience, very few of the rules were error-free. The most common errors were errors of omission (leaving elements out that should have been included) rather than errors of commission (including elements which should not be part of the rule). These findings have implications for the design of the Flip language, which aims to support young people as they begin to develop computational skills through game design.

AB  - Our qualitative research was inspired by the 75-year long Harvard University Happiness Survey.In October-November 2022, 65 young marketing undergraduates from Generation Z were asked what value and happiness meant to them. Today’s 20-year-olds were forced to live one tenth of their lives, i.e., 2 years, locked in their homes, isolated from friends and university peers, during the COVID -19 pandemic. Hardly had they recovered from the threat of the pandemic, from their grief, when they were hit by another trauma, as were other members of society. War in neighbouring Ukraine, serious energy crisis, climate crisis, skyrocketing inflation, uncertain future…The focus of the research was therefore on the question of what kind of life they would be satisfied with, and what they would do to achieve the quality of life they want. What goals do they have, what do they want to achieve in their lives? Are human relationships important to them? As our interviewees were marketing students, we asked them if they were happy buying a product or using a service, how important is the experience of buying a product or service to them? How do they think about this topic, what strategy do they want to follow as marketing employees based on their life experiences? Their way of thinking is also decisive at a societal level.

AB  - Agility - like the XXI. one of the fashionable concepts and leading approaches of the 20th century - it came into the spotlight after the 2000s. At first, as a new project management methodology, it was included in the thinking, which is able to eliminate the shortcomings and slowness of the classic waterfall model, thus making project management more efficient, directing them towards successful projects. Seeing the success of agile project management, more and more companies and businesses began to agileize their various organizational units as well, and finally the mindset spread to the whole organization. Today, we interpret the concept of agility not only at the organizational level, but also at the individual level. However, the willingness of individuals and employees to agility differs along a number of factors. It is influenced by an individual's age, generation affiliation, education, culture, which determines the extent to which he or she is able to embrace this new way of thinking. In our study, we look for the answer to what agility means as a term in the reading of respondents of each generation. The basis of our study is a questionnaire research carried out in Hungary, which was also part of an international research.

AB  - In 1985, Diener and his colleagues presented an objective evaluation of life satisfaction using a questionnaire composed of five items: ideal, condition, satisfaction, acquisition, and change. Since Diener, many scholars have proposed a new measure of life satisfaction and have conducted various studies. Future life satisfaction so far, which is based on a 5-point Likert scale and the questioner's subjective score, are categorized using uniform fuzzy partition in this paper. The fuzzy probabilities belonging to each category are estimated using the split table for categorized life satisfaction. The expectancy rate of future life satisfaction is calculated using the fuzzy probabilities for the satisfaction of the current and future life. This study surveyed 216 enrolled students at K University and used the life path number of Pythagorean numerology to compare the expectancy rate of future life satisfaction according to temperament. The life path number was divided into a thinking type, a realistic type, and a feeling type. We confirm that the thinking type have the highest expectancy rate for future life.

AB  - Cognitive Computing is a developing paradigm with its applications found in almost every field. It aims to develop computing methodologies and systems inspired by mind’s capabilities. A thought is the most fundamental capability of the mind. Hence it is important in the cognitive computing to understand the Thought Process. The purpose of this paper is to develop a computer model that simulates the Thought Process. The paper proposes that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be used for the same. Both cognitive model and computer model of the thought process with the help of GA has been given. In the computer model, a modification of GA has been implemented, which consists of a new crossover operator called Learning Crossover operator. The new crossover operator is not a replacement but is a supplement to the existing crossover operators. The GA is implemented over the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP), which is a classical NP problem and hence the algorithm is possible to be implemented on any other problem. The modification to the GA aims to improve the Thought Process Simulation. But it can also improve the performance of GA, when further explored.

These new technologies, ideas and approaches provide a new environment for researching and developing the economy-based resource scheduling system. Aiming at the hierarchical grid model, following load balancing thinking and cost-time optimization strategies, this paper proposes a new grid resource scheduling algorithm, which can not only increase the utilization of resources and system throughput, but also realize the load balancing and utility optimization between resource providers and users within grid systems. On the basis of having described the different functional parts of the proposed algorithm, two kinds of simulative experiments about completion time and cost of tasks are conducted. Finally, the experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is effective.

AB  - This paper is about a particular technical problem in the study of autonomy in computational systems: how can a computing system invent and use its own symbols and symbol construction mechanisms? We think this invention is necessary for intelligent behavior in any organism, artificial or otherwise, since it has been observed repeatedly that systems with fixed symbol sets get stuck. This observation is well-known in computing circles, and has been observed in "extensible" languages, large and growing knowledge bases, content-based filing systems for technical literature, and inheritance hierarchies for large object-oriented systems: no matter what elaboration mechanisms are used, no matter what initial structures are used, the structures eventually become too constrained by what is already there, and stagnate. To change that phenomenon, we need construction mechanisms that can themselves be changed and elaborated. We think that if we can change the construction mechanisms (which include the alphabet, as the mechanisms for constructing expressions from nothing), that is, the basic units that combine or are combined to make the structures, then we have another way to escape the trap of creeping rigidity: we can elaborate the units out from underneath the existing structures. This brings us directly to computational semiotics, which for us is the study of the treatment and use of symbols in computing systems. This paper is primarily intended to stimulate discussion and further research in these areas, since the questions are very hard and have no easy answers.

AB  - In this paper, we explain how an existing computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems was improved and adapted to suit the domain of chess endgame studies. Studies are typically longer and more “sophisticated” in terms of their perceived aesthetics or beauty. They are therefore likely a better test of the capability of machines to evaluate beauty in the game. Based on current validation methods for an aesthetics model such as this, the experimental results confirm that the adaptation was successful. In the first experiment, the new model enabled a computer program to distinguish correctly between composed studies and positions with sequences resembling studies taken from real games. In the second, the computational aesthetic evaluations were shown to correlate positively and well with human expert aesthetic assessment. The new model encompasses the previous three-mover one and can be used to evaluate beauty as perceived by humans in both domains. This technology pushes the boundaries of computational chess and can be of benefit to human players, composers, and judges. To some extent, it may also contribute to our understanding of the psychology of human aesthetic perception and the “mechanics” of human creativity in composing problems and studies.

However, understanding the meaning of these prompts in AI remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for extracting Cartoon images via UML Models based on natural language-based specifications, mapping a cut image's cartoon elements with UML properties extracted through linguistic textual analysis in software engineering. We expect software engineers to automatically help toon writers generate a cartoon's image with linguistic mechanisms.

AB  - In this paper, we create a learning path and curate projects that let students learn certain computational concepts in a consistent way that bridges story, conversation, visual programming, and text-based programming. Our approach is to provide young children with both visual and text-based programming materials that are directly associated with the computational logic in some selected children’s daily dialogues and stories. We demonstrate this combo-design idea with examples of roleplaying, Snap! program, and Python code. Our design pattern and examples could be adapted to other suitable children’s activities in different school settings on a variety of technology platforms.

This includes adding into our models and computational systems, the behavior, constraints on and policies of institutions and cultures, as well as social behaviors and social dynamics that are not institutionalized. Then we will address three hard questions: How does adding social, cultural and institutional information to our computational systems change our goals for and our approaches to these systems? How do we evaluate the success of sociotechnical systems? What are some of the key challenges to building sociotechnical systems?

AB  - Several instruments have been used for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities. In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. We expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on CT assessment as well as to the Bebras effort to educate CT.

AB  - The study explores the effects of an interdisciplinary learning approach on developing students’ English learning (EL) and computational thinking (CT) through two different game-based learning approaches. A quasi-experiment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students’ CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students take part in the experiment, of whom 28 are assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 are assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. Results indicate that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in English-language achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; and 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produces a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge, their learning anxieties are also lower than those of the control group. The analysis of behavioral patterns also reveals that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrate better language-learning interaction, whereas the students playing character-ER board game present greater CT development in finding solutions.

AB  - Automatic grading systems help lessen the load of manual grading. Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student com-petency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so. Additionally, survey responses from course teachers support the importance of our work.

AB  - This paper proposes the synthesis of Petri net supervisors based on a think-globally-actlocally (TGAL) approach and a vector covering technique for flexible manufacturing systems. Given a Petri net model with deadlocks, the TGAL approach first temporarily adds a global idle place (GP). A GP has initially only one token. Then, we generate the reachability graph of the net model with the GP. If there are deadlocks, we find all the legal markings and first-met bad markings (FBMs). The legal markings and FBMs that need to be considered can be reduced by using a vector covering approach. An integer linear programming problem is formulated to design a set of control places to forbid all FBMs but no legal markings. Meanwhile, the redundancy of the obtained control places is checked to remove the redundant ones. Then, we increase one token in the GP and compute a set of control place again. This process is carried out until the reachable markings of the Petri net model do not increase when the number of tokens in the GP is increased. As a result, we can find a set of control places to make the Petri net model live. Finally, some Petri net examples from the literature are used to demonstrate the proposed methods. It can be verified that the obtained supervisors can lead to more reachable markings, since the obtained control places are maximally permissive at each iteration.

AB  - Computational thinking is irrefutably a must-have skill in today's digital world. This is why it is a requisite course in most college curricula. Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on “waste management”. The methodology implemented for this task is developed based on a prescribed course syllabus and assessment structure which promotes student-centered and inter-disciplinary learning.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel framework that melds the profound tenets of Indian philosophy with AI and ML. Our goal is to create models that replicate human cognition, paving the way for robots that think like us. Key concepts from Indian philosophy, including ”buddhi,” ”manas,” ”chit,” and ”ahamkar,” are woven into the framework, enhancing AI’s ability to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way. The core of the framework consists of ”Buddhi” and ”Manas.” Buddhi, a discriminative AI component, adeptly navigates sensory data, making decisions aligned with human discernment. Complementing it, ”Manas” is a generative core, capable of crafting narratives and generating creative solutions. This synergy creates an iterative loop that encapsulates human thought, enabling machines to think, visualize, and even dream. In addition to advancing AI and ML research, we conducted an experiment using a modified News Aggregator dataset from the UCI repository. The experiment focused on word prediction, and our model, infused with Indian philosophy, outperformed RNN and LSTM models over 30 epochs. This framework has the potential to revolutionize AI and create more human-like machines, ushering in a new era of AI and robotics.

AB  - Design is a creative, complex, and iterative process. Although a variety of AI models for supporting design has been developed, there is little research on providing a seamless flow across multiple AI models, as well as the inspiration evolution within the process. We present an integrated AI-based Creativity Support Tool(AI-CST) that systematically integrates multiple AI models and contains a novel Inpiration Evolver to facilitate collaboration between designers and AI models. A between-subject sneaker-design experiment comparing our integrated AI-CST and non-integrated AI-CST shows that our AI-CST can significantly improve designers’ performance. Different using preferences and evolution styles have been discovered by the Inspiration Evolver, which inspires further study on the adaptation of the integrated AI-CST.

Definition of knowledge for indirect communication between engineers by the interpretation of product model is discussed through human thinking driven product definition, sources of human intent at product definition, and concept of extension of product definition to information content. A concept is shown for the modeling of advising background knowledge as information content considering engineering objects in real world product structure. A new multilevel product model is detailed. In this model, enhanced human intent based decision making is assisted by organized engineering object information and information content on levels of product model. Finally, some future plans are outlined for the work that is devoted as a contribution to intelligent product modeling for the every day engineering in product lifecycle management (PLM) systems.

AB  - The paper outlines some direct solution strategies for sparse matrices arising from the finite element (FE) discretization of electromagnetic (EM) models, and explores whether the conventional thinking followed by highly optimized direct method tools for sparse matrices is indeed the best available option for directly solving FEM problems in EM. Factorization memory and time, solution time, parallelization potential, and error will be considered in the comparisons between approaches. Drawing from advances in the area of integral equation (IE) methods that rely on relatively small but dense matrices, we will conjecture that direct solvers that minimize factorization fill-in while maintaining sparsity may not lead to the best overall strategy after all. We present an direct solution algorithm for FEM, based on domain decomposition that generates and operates on a lesser sparse matrix with block-wise sparse pattern, thus bridging the gap between the two extreme matrix structures, (a large fully sparse encountered in FEM and a smaller fully dense encountered in IE methods). Early results on 3D arbitrary tetrahedron meshes and arbitrary volumetric geometries suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art sparse matrix direct solvers in terms of memory while maintaining competitive run times for serial implementations.

AB  - Technological advancements have resulted in a deluge of innovative activities, each requiring rigorous investigation and appraisal. The report recognizes the need for a centralized forum to address these limits by allowing innovators to propose their ideas to domain experts and peers. An online platform where students may submit projects, have them reviewed by mentors, and examine other students’ projects. An assessment of existing systems identified a variety of restrictions for students. Such a platform aims to inspire creative thinking and the execution of unique ideas, hence helping students by boosting cooperation, networking, and project-based learning. This platform serves as a dynamic social hub, allowing students to communicate, present work, and exchange ideas in a lively digital setting. The major project is at the center of a student’s academic journey, a necessary component of their graduation process that challenges them to apply their gathered knowledge to create something unique. Students are currently unaware of their peers accomplishment due to a lack of engagement. This website seeks to address this issue by allowing students to discover their skills and find inspiration for their projects. The platform is intended to streamline the tasks of project mentors and teams. Furthermore, developing a dedicated web portal for our college community enhances access to completed projects, making it a great resource for students of all levels. Centralizing project information aims to encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration, ultimately improving the learning experience and developing a culture of student-driven innovation.

AB  - Problem solving plays a central role in computer science classes, whereby the problems to be analyzed are often already available in encoded form. The initial process where the learners have to parse information into symbols using adequate representations, has hardly been considered systematically so far. However, encoding development is essential for the understanding of sign processes and for general education. This paper therefore presents the development and evaluation of a teaching unit called “Cup Song Encoding” designed to model information encoding using a percussion song as an example. It simultaneously imparts coding theory concepts and fosters Computational Thinking of students. The material of the teaching unit is available online. The teaching unit was successfully tested with over 200 students in different age groups in K-12 during which the students' solutions were recorded and examined. The outcomes of the unit demonstrate the potential for encoding modeling to be a valuable addition to K-12 computer science education. The results also show how Computational Thinking methods can be integrated in computer science classes.

AB  - The use of microorganisms for the production of industrially important compounds and enzymes is becoming increasingly important. Eukaryotes have been less widely used than prokaryotes in biotechnology, because of the complexity of their genomic structure and biology. The Yeast2.0 project is an international effort to engineer the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to make it easy to manipulate, and to generate random variants using a system called SCRaMbLE. SCRaMbLE relies on artificial evolution in vitro to identify useful variants, an approach which is time consuming and expensive. We developed an in silico simulator for the SCRaMbLE system, using an evolutionary computing approach, which can be used to investigate and optimize the fitness landscape of the system. We applied the system to the investigation of the fitness landscape of one of the S. cerevisiae chromosomes, and found that our results fitted well with those previously published. Our simulator can be applied to the analysis of the fitness landscapes of any organism for which SCRaMbLE has been implemented.

AB  - Progress in AI (artificial intelligence) is bottlenecked by contemporary thinking. Soft computing methodologies recognize the fundamental role of imprecision in any computational intelligence. This paper goes one step further in that it recognizes the fundamental need for heuristics - both as a generalization of numeric imprecision according to S.H. Rubin (1999) and, as a consequence, of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem by V.A. Uspenskii (1987). Heuristic ontologies were compared with logical ontologies and shown to be advantageous for the realization of intelligent computation. It was also noted how the mechanics of evolutionary biology and that presupposed for thought can be computationally equivalent. In particular, randomness and symmetry by G.J. Chaitin (1975) are shown to underpin computational evolution by providing for heuristic discovery, knowledge transference and creative computation. The capability for the transference of heuristic knowledge was evidenced to be fundamental to the evolution of what M. Minsky (1987) has termed, "a society of mind". The need for transformational representations of this knowledge was demonstrated by S. Amarel (1968). A modeling language, designed to exploit domain symmetries, was characterized for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Applications to UAVs and intelligent agents - among a plethora of others - will follow. In conclusion, Marvin Minsky argues that many AI researchers seem to have lost their way in recent years and should be investigating core problems such as how a person reasons according to C.T. Clark. It is hoped that this paper will sow the seeds for a proper response to Minsky's admonition by inciting a restoration in the type of creative thinking that attracted many AI researchers into the field in the first place.

AB  - The aim of the system presented in this paper is to assess the current risk level based on personal parameters during sport activity. In these kinds of monitoring systems the patient-specific evaluation is essential to obtain realistic result thereby making use of the system more secure. This requirement is fulfilled by the risk assessment framework published by the author and her colleagues. However, it is also equally important to obtain the accurate result in time to avoid the serious consequences. In order to address this problem in this paper the author presents some evaluation structure reduction techniques which reduce the computational need of the risk assessment. These models are the modifications of the conventional Mamdani-type inference system maintaining its advantageous properties while the computational complexity is reduced and the result is equivalent to the conventional system result.

AB  - Computational creativity is defined as the ability of artificial systems to generate artifacts with substantial novelty and originality, comparable to those crafted by human experts. This study introduces an innovative approach to implementing computational creativity in the scientific domain, exemplified through the automatic generation of trigonometric identities using a novel LeakGAN model, a Generative Adversarial Network with leaked information. The novelty of the proposed LeakGAN lies in its discriminator model, constructed on the foundation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), aimed at capturing the most relevant features from input data. These features are subsequently leaked to the generator model, enabling the production of identities with substantial originality and quality. The introduced novelty in the discriminator’s architecture encompasses the use of a new activation function called Mish, strategically employed to enhance the network's convergence rate and address over-fitting issues during training. Additionally, an attention layer is introduced to highlight the most relevant information within the feature space, thereby improving the network's learning capacity. Furthermore, a unique mixed pooling layer is utilized, combining the advantageous effects of max-pooling and average pooling operations to enhance the network's adaptability to varying feature distributions. Performance analysis, incorporating BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metrics and various comparative studies, substantiates the efficacy of the proposed LeakGAN model in generating novel identities compared to its traditional counterparts. Moreover, human evaluation involving 20 mathematical experts confirms the significant novelty of the generated identities compared to existing standard textbook problems. Consequently, the proposed technique proves valuable for generating diverse trigonometric identities suitable for inclusion as chapter-end exercises in middle school mathematics textbooks.

AB  - Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in science and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android. The generation process is based on the integration of the Ionic/Cordova and AngularJS technologies into EjsS. Finally, we present several working examples based on the works of Open Source Physics at Singapore.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Adaptive Brain-Inspired Emotional Decayed Learning named Fuzzy ADBEL. Fuzzy ADBEL is a computational model that models the forgetting process and inhibitory mechanism of the emotional brain. In the model, the fuzzy decay rate simulates the forgetting process, and the stimulus and learning weights are considered as fuzzy variables trained by fuzzy learning rules. The final output of the model is evaluated by a fuzzy decision making layer that simulates the inhibitory mechanism. The proposed Fuzzy ADBEL is utilized to predict the Kp, AE and Dst indices showing opposite behaviors and characterizing the chaotic activity of the earth's magnetosphere. Experimental results show that fuzzy approaches including Fuzzy ADBEL and ANFIS (Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System) reaches steady state faster than non-fuzzy approaches, ADBEL and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). Hence, we hope the proposed model can be used in real time chaotic time series prediction.

We developed a game where a robot has to assemble a sandwich, collecting a specific list of ingredients. Our game follows principles and offers game mechanics typical of games for learning programming. The main innovation of our game is that it visualizes the generality property of algorithms through double levels, that we call twin-worlds, in which one same algorithm is executed by two robots in assembling their sandwiches. Results from early testing with university students enrolled in the education of Media Studies show that the game is usable, levels can be solved at various degrees of complexity (e.g. with and without using loops), and that the students were able to make sense of our twin-worlds levels and formulate general algorithms for both worlds. However, the gathered feedback also highlights the need to explore alternative implementations of the twin-worlds concept.

AB  - The basic cognitive architecture of our brain is still unknown. However, scientists have found evidence for existence of distinct behavioral control systems shared by humans and nonhumans. Inspired by the problem solving systems of the behavioral control in the primate brain, a hierarchical computational model is presented. We focus on the integrative performance of brain substructures, each of which is represented by a problem solver that is further modeled by a certain algorithm. Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones. Different problem solvers share a same slice of working memory. This novelty is claimed since most of existing brain models emphasize on the neural network structure even though the neuron dynamics of brain is still very controversial. And we compare its performance to three other computational models in the face of a challenging foraging problem. Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios. Further, the results discover that the virtues of our primate brain lie not only in the heights of thinking it can reach, but also in its range and versatility.

AB  - The human mind crucially thinks and reasons, all the while being conscious. Possible architectures to achieve the first two of these attributes are proposed, the first of these being based on those for the mental simulation loop suggested as being at the basis of thinking. Simulations of the architectures, drawn from infant development and reasoning at a non-linguistic level, justify their ability to achieve their aims. How these activities may become conscious briefly presented as part of the attention control systems (motor and sensory) involved in the overall architecture.

AB  - This WIP exposes the design and implementation of Midroid, an open mobile platform focused on microcontrollers' education. The platform has been designed with the aim to address both the problems detected as the educational gaps associated to the acquisition of the algorithmic thinking needed in the conceptualization and structuring of a program or algorithm determined. To technical level, the platform consists in two elements: a mobile application for Android operating system and a development board which the students can debugging their algorithms. Thereby, the educational concept of the platform takes into account the challenges related to the mobility of technology, learning and the learner. As educational framework, it has selected the concept of Computational Thinking (CT) in the stages of design of the platform. The CT is a kind of process that allows solve a problem through procedures such as abstraction, modeling, arguing and algorithmic processing. Furthermore, the CT allows the use of computers or tools such as mobile devices or both computational and mathematical programs as way to resolve the formulated problems in a knowledge area. These aspects were needed in the design and implementation of the platform in the areas of hardware and software respectively. It is expected with this research, the design and implementation of a mobile platform related to microcontrollers; area which addresses the problems mentioned and also enhances the learning process in the students. The educational and technical validation of the platform will be developed through qualitative study between different groups of students in the subjects of the curriculum concerning the microcontrollers' area, thus, validating the impact of the platform.

AB  - The power systems of the future - smart grids - will see an increase in both renewable energy sources and load demand, thus increasing the need for fast dynamic reconfiguration of system parameters to handle energy and load dispatches. Power systems will need to be monitored continuously to maintain stability under normal and abnormal operating conditions and when facing disturbances. A combination of system state prediction, dynamic power flow, system optimization, and solution stability checking will allow for a more reliable, affordable, efficient and clean power grid. The optimization and control systems on a smart grid will require a computational systems thinking capability to handle the uncertainties and variability that exist in a smart grid environment. The concept of sense-making based on computational intelligence methods, including neural networks, fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence, as well as online measurements from a smart grid to provide `situational' awareness in the context of stability, is introduced in this paper.

AB  - Implementing a virtual production system is challenging. Production systems are constrained by different dynamical market changes and characterised by complex general and machine specific interactions, uncertainties and unknowns. These complications make predicting the behaviour by any deterministic computer model not only inaccurate but sometimes misleading, e.g. if the range of a model's applicability is not sufficiently well identified. Thus it is crucial to implement a virtual production system that supports learning from data and existing knowledge in the iterative design of models and their range of applicability - such a systematic design approach integrates real versus virtual data with digital versus human creativity and intelligence. The theory of design oriented thinking adapted for manufacturing favours fast iteration in digitised design cycles instead of optimisation of model quality in one step.

AB  - Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.

AB  - The paper suggests how to model a computational perception of reality, situational awareness, cognition and machine learning, in the system of Computational Systemic Deep Mind. The modules of this model, determine the states of objects in the environment of unknown in advance situation, represent and realize the objects by machine memory, display the objects to be recognized by systems and humans. The method applies to the principles of the systemic and situational control, the main achievements of fuzzy logic, linguistics and cyber-physical approach to the perception, understanding and processing of languages, images, signals and other essences of reality. The functionality of this method is based on the following interconnected modules: 1) situational fuzzy control of data, information, knowledge, objects and subsystems; 2) fuzzy inference; 3) decisions making; 4) knowledge representation; 5) knowledge generalization; 6) reasoning; 7) systems thinking; and 8) intelligent user interface. The use of this method allows to be self-organized under uncertainty and to operate autonomously in various subject areas.

The major goal of the first part is to create a new way of thinking about politics and economy, viewing them from a different perspective, not only as humanity disciplines but also considering engineering and computational patterns in these sciences. Next, we focus on designing an integrated intelligent government (IIG) by partitioning a government's structure into different intelligent agents which use diverse knowledge bases and inference methodologies. Finally, we illustrate the role of electronic technology in a novel governing framework from various angles and come up with new ideas in this regard to develop participation, democratization, etc by an international electronic government (IEG)

AB  - Membrane Computing (MC) or so called P system is a computing machine that was first introduced by Gheorghe Paun in 1998. MC; being inspired from biological reactions occurring inside a living cell; represents a new methodology for writing algorithms and for thinking. In this paper we borrow some immunity flavor and add it to the framework of MC. The new addition is a way of thinking and designing MC algorithms. It eliminates the need for a checking phase in an MC algorithm. There can be many interpretations for the concept of adding Immunity to P systems. In this paper, one interpretation is introduced in which Immunity is interpreted as a set of rules that protects membranes against generation or evolution of unwanted objects. Hence; it is guaranteed that if the system developed an answer then it is correct otherwise the final step will be reached with no membranes.

AB  - Globally, women account for a small percentage of students and professionals in ICT-related fields. In order to increase female participation in this area, governments worldwide have been facilitating targeted interventions. One such initiative is the ‘Guyanese Girls Code’ (GGC) training program. This program was launched in 2018 with the aim of using Scratch and the BBC micro:bit to introduce girls at the Grade 7 to 9 levels to ICT education. In this paper, we propose a novel teaching model, the ‘Motivation, Support and Teaching Components’ tree model (MST-tree model). This model was critical to the design of GGC’s curriculum and teaching strategies. An evaluation was conducted to gather information on the program participants’ ICT perceptions and their experience of the training. The key findings revealed that the participants had a significant interest in learning about ICT even though they perceived the area to be difficult and local training opportunities to build their knowledge and skills were insufficient. Further, the girls portrayed high levels of self-efficacy, since they were interested in the program modules that they perceived to be most challenging. These findings suggest that the teaching model may address negative ICT perceptions when teaching females at the Grade 7 to 9 levels. As such, the MST-tree model has the potential to inform the design and execution of similar training programs and interventions.

It may well be tied to the very fabric of how nature works!

AB  - A variant of Mitchell's version space algorithm is studied. The changes to computational cost and predictive accuracy that result from artificially linearizing certain featural dimensions that are in fact nominal (unstructured) are investigated. It is shown that one must be highly selective in choosing which features to artificially linearize. An information theoretic measure is used to identify a small number of features whose value-sets best differentiate between positive and negative training examples. The resulting algorithm's computational costs approximately double; its predictive accuracy also improves, but, surprisingly, only modestly for the soybean disease dataset which is used as a testbed.<>

AB  - This document presents the results of the development of a learning program on computational thinking through programming challenges with robots oriented to early childhood. The methodological approach used was quantitative, using a quasi-experimental design, taking pretest/posttest measures, with experimental and control groups. The sample of participating students was 46. They belonged to a group of first grade of primary education, aged between 6 and 7 years, in a Spanish educational center. The learning of computational thinking was measured through the following dimensions: algorithmic thinking-sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used were an adaptation of the activities proposed in the “TangibleK” robotics curriculum. The results generated show positive effects in relation to the level of achievement reached by the students in the proposed challenges; in other words, there is a significant effect on the mastery of skills related to computational thinking. Differences were found between the pretest and posttest measures of the experimental group. Those of the latter group were statistically significant and higher than those of the control group. Therefore, we can statistically attribute the mastery of computational thinking skills to the participation in the training activities.

AB  - Computational creative systems have the potential to augment the creative design process, particularly in co-creative contexts. We present a computational model for generating visual conceptual blends in the domain of sketching. Our system is motivated by the desire to encourage curiosity, facilitate creative ideation, and overcome design fixation. We start with a model for “conceptual shift”: when a sketch recognized as belonging to one category is visually similar to a sketch from a semantically distinct category. Identifying a potential conceptual shift enables visual analogy and/or conceptual blending. The intent is that these conceptually shifted or blended sketches could be presented to designers to encourage analogical reasoning and creative outcomes. We define and demonstrate our model for the conceptual shift task and alternative approaches for enabling conceptual blends. We describe future plans for evaluation in co-creative contexts.

AB  - Denial and wishful thinking are well known affective phenomena that influence human belief processes. Put simply, they consist of tendencies to disbelieve what one would not like to be true, and believe what one would like to be true. We present an approach to an agent's belief dynamics, that simulates denial and wishful thinking, using the agent's goals as the source of affective preference. Our approach also addresses several issues concerning the use of conventional belief revision in human-like autonomous agents. In our approach, every goal produces a wishful thought about its achievement, in the form of a weak belief. Consequently, a “disliked situation” leads to inconsistent beliefs, thus triggering belief revision. Furthermore, the agent's belief set is selected based on a measure of preference that accounts for the “likeability” of beliefs (among other factors). We test an instantiation of our model to assess whether the resulting agent could produce the intended behaviors. The agent produces behaviors of denial and wishful thinking, not only as biases in belief selection, but also as the triggers to hold or reject certain beliefs.

AB  - The human brain is at least a factor of 1 billion more efficient than our present digital technology, and a factor of 10 million more efficient than the best digital technology that we can imagine today. The unavoidable conclusion is that we have something fundamental to learn from the human brain about a new and much more effective form of computation, with a convenient, effective, efficient and reliable bottom-up (BU) approach. In another paper presented at this conference we focused on the computational information conservation properties of optimized numeric words with precisation of meaning. Here, we present a brain-inspired geometric-logical scheme defining fundamental human linguistic and predicative competence. According to CICT, complete duality of Opposition and Implication Geometry in Logical Geometry and Language can model n-dimensional predicative competence and beyond, according to available computational resources. In any case, their combination may provide even a concrete opportunity for the foundation of computational psychiatry and for reformulating psychoanalytical theory in a sharable way.

AB  - In this paper, we present our design of a high school summer course which uses our Visual Design Problem-based Learning Pedagogy using Virtual Environments as a strategy to teach computer science. Students solved visual design problems by creating 3D sculptures in an online virtual environment. These creations were further explored and refined in immersive display systems fostering embodied learning and remote peer presence and support. To achieve the desired design, students use programming and computing concepts, such as loops, to solve those visual design centered problems, i.e. solving for composition, positive/negative space, balance, as opposed to computational problems first, i.e. create a loop, a fractal, randomized lines, etc. We present results from a study conducted on three high school summer courses. We compared the use of our Visual Design Problem-based teaching strategy (students wrote code to solve challenges based on art and design principles) to a traditional strategy (students wrote code to demonstrate comprehension of computer science concepts). Our results showed that test scores were higher for students in our Visual Design Problem-based courses. This work may have a positive impact on computer science education by increasing engagement, knowledge acquisition, and self-directed learning.

AB  - “The basis of computer hardware technology” is a public basic course of engineering in colleges and universities, the course content has a strong theoretical, engineering and practical nature. In the past, teaching mainly focus on the professional knowledge and skills, lacking in the cultivation of thinking, philosophy, politics and humanistic quality. In this paper, we make a preliminary exploration on the teaching design of curriculum ideological and political education in “The basis of computer hardware technology” course, and the ADDIE model is introduced to integrate the elements of ideological and political in classroom lectures, after-school assignments, course experiments and examinations, through the combination of “knowledge transfer and value guidance” by taking professional knowledge education as the carrier, to further improve students' scientific and humanistic qualities, to establish students' sound moral principles and deep national sentiments, to promote students' all-round development, and to meet the needs of talent cultivation.

AB  - Virtual Experiment (VE) plays an important role for fostering the student's high-level thinking and problem-solving abilities. Accordingly, VE has become the popular method to assist teachers in science teaching and students in practicing due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive of the Real Experiment (RE). However, the teaching and learning performance may be limited because the most of the existing VE systems cannot efficiently, automatically analyze and diagnose the students' VE operational portfolio. Therefore, this study proposes a Virtual Experiment Diagnosis Scheme (VEDS) to automatically diagnose the operational portfolio based on teacher-defined diagnostic knowledge and further to offer students the Visualized Personalized Diagnostic Report to describe the learning problems with suggestion for fostering the self-learning and experiment abilities.

AB  - The human culture and cognition are consequence of the thinking capability of human, and thinking is a social activity. People have similar idea and opinion interacts, and interactions force people to have similar idea and interaction take place locally. However, its effect is global. In this study, we try to determine define the computational thinking for saplings growing up algorithm (SGuA) which belongs to evolutionary algorithms. Thinking capability can be defined based on the process interaction for similar solutions. SGuA has four operators: mating, branching, vaccinating and surviving. We determined the computational thinking capability for each operator. Finally, we determined computational thinking capability of SGuA.

AB  - Since 2014, nearly 2 million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia to escape an economically devastated country during what is one of the largest humanitarian crises in modern history. Non-government organizations and local government units are faced with having to identify, assess, and monitor rapidly growing migrant communities in order to provide urgent humanitarian aid. However, with many of these displaced populations living in informal settlements areas across the country, locating migrant settlements over large territories can be a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for rapidly and cost-effectively locating new and emerging informal settlements using machine learning and publicly accessible Sentinel-2 time series satellite imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying potential Venezuelan migrant settlements that have emerged between 2015 and 2020 in Colombia. Finally, we emphasize the importance of post-classification verification and present a two-step validation approach consisting of (1) remote validation using Google Earth and (2) on-the-ground validation through the Premise App, a mobile crowdsourcing platform.

AB  - Summary form only given. A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science are used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations of corresponding activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational science and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vigor and empirical approach without the support of a formal model and a rigorous means. In order to formally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of the brain are sought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of the natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics. A wide range of applications of the cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC and my laboratory such as , inter alia, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, and cognitive automobiles.

AB  - Teachers face challenges in teaching new subjects at the early primary level. The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly.

AB  - Understanding computing concepts is one of the foundational elements of computational thinking, which helps students formulate logic and algorithms for effectively developing and designing codes. However, novice learners often struggle to understand basic computing concepts, such as variables, loops, arrays, conditionals, and functions. This is often caused by the invisibility of the computing mechanism and the complexity of language syntax and conventions. Moreover, challenges in learning computing concepts can be compounded for learners with atypical conditions (e.g. visual, cognitive, and learning impairment, attention deficit, and neurodivergence). To tackle this, teachers of typical ability learners frequently use notional machines (NMs) - simplified representations (e.g. diagrams, flow charts, and analogies) created to assist novice programmers in understanding abstract concepts, program execution, and dynamics. In addition, traditional learning activities may need assistive learning interventions (ALIs) and learner-oriented practices like physical tactile models, computing artifacts, and interactive learning tools. NM approaches tend to focus on the explanation of concepts from instructor to learner, while ALIs tend to focus on learner support in activities. Both methods can provide advantages for learning, and we expect that a combined approach would provide even greater synergy for all learners. However, little consideration has been given to how NM and ALI approaches could be effectively combined. This research investigates how NM and ALI can be effectively brought together more holistically as an inclusive pedagogical tool - notional machines for inclusive learning (NMIL). In this full paper, we develop the conceptualization of NMIL, grounded in previous NM and ALI research. We also propose a structured method for creating NMIL. Finally, we also develop a physical NMIL model, based on the structured NMIL creation method, to teach lists in Python, as part of an introductory computer science course.

AB  - People often encounter highly stressful, emotion-evoking situations. Modeling and predicting people's behavior in such situations, how they cope, is a critical research topic. To that end, we propose a computational model of coping that casts Lazarus's theory of coping into a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. This includes an appraisal process that models the factors leading to stress by assessing a person's relation to the environment and a coping process that models how people seek to reduce stress by directly altering the environment or changing one's beliefs and goals. We evaluated the model's assumptions in the context of a high-stress situation, hurricanes. We collected questionnaire data from major U.S. hurricanes in 2018 to evaluate the model's features for appraisal calculation. We also conducted a series of controlled experiments simulating a hurricane experience to investigate how people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation. The results support the model's assumptions showing that the proposed features are significantly associated with the evacuation decisions and people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation.

With the development of visual programming languages such as Scratch, this movement has emerged again in recent years, as teachers at all educational levels and from different disciplines consider that the use of programming enhances learning in many subjects and allows students to develop important skills. The systematic literature review presented in this article aims to summarize the results of recent research using programming with Scratch in subjects not related to computing and communications, as well as studies analyzing the kind of skills students develop while learning to code in this environment. Although the analyzed papers provide promising results regarding the use of programming as an educational resource, this review highlights the need to conduct more empirical research in classrooms, using larger samples of students that allow to obtain clear conclusions about the types of learning that could be enhanced through programming.

AB  - Robotics is now increasingly popular in the education system worldwide as it is one of the core technology enablers for Industry 4.0. Robotics is deemed to be able to promote students' STEM interest and 21st century skills. However, not all the students have the access to robotics, especially in Sibu, East Malaysia. This research presents the implementation of a low-cost Maker Uno educational robotics kit and its associated learning experience of the learners, which were seventy-six Foundation in Science (FIS) students in University College of Technology Sarawak (UCTS). The aim of this study is to investigate the students' empirical STEM robotics learning experience by offering them an opportunity to explore a low-cost self-assembled robotics car. Questionnaire and interviews that constitute a mixed method research were employed to investigate the present situation and derive at a solution to the problem. The findings showed that the proposed robotics activities were beneficial for the students to exercise 21st century skills and cultivate STEM interests. Educators could potentially benefit from applying this robotics pedagogical exemplary to help the students to cultivate STEM interests and 21st century skills. Future research on innovation exemplary, particularly on low-cost robotics applications and robotics education methods can be explored.

AB  - Scaling of simulations challenges the effectiveness of conventional visualization methods. This problem becomes two-fold for mesoscale weather models that operate in near-real-time at cloud-scale resolution. For example, typical approaches to vector field visualization (e.g., wind) are based upon global methods, which may not illustrate detailed structure. In addition, such computations employ multi-resolution meshes to capture small-scale phenomena, which are not properly reflected in both vector and scalar realizations. To address the former critical point analysis and simple bandpass filtering of wind fields is employed for better seed point identification of streamline calculations. For the latter, an encapsulation of nested computational meshes is developed for general realization. It is then combined with the seed point calculation for an improved vector visualization of multi-resolution weather forecasting data.

AB  - Levinthal's application of Kauffman's NK model to economic firms continues to be one of the most accepted computational models in organization science. Levinthal investigates the impact to organizational fitness from both adaptive search and the interactions of strategic components within an organization. Despite concerns regarding the applicability of Kauffman's NK model to organization science, Levintha's initial study has received limited critical analysis and has not been independently replicated. Building on previous replication research of Tivnan, this paper describes the formulation, successful replication and critical analysis of Levintha's model of emergent order in contribution towards a model-centered organization science. The paper concludes with a discussion of a credibility assessment of the replication results; namely, model verification and validation.

To address this problem, we study its computational complexity and formulate a binary integer linear programming (BILP) for an exact resolution, which meets IC targets and minimizes the total cost of the schedule for the selected actions. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model, a numerical example based on a French textile company is considered.

AB  - The cooperative coevolution (CC) framework achieves a promising performance in solving large scale global optimization problems. The framework encounters difficulties on nonseparable problems, where variables interact with each other. Using the static grouping methods, variables will be theoretically grouped into one big subcomponent, whereas the random grouping strategy endures low efficiency. In this paper, a dynamic CC framework is proposed to tackle the challenge. The proposed framework works in a computationally efficient manner, in which the computational resources are allocated to a series of elitist subcomponents consisting of superior variables. First, a novel estimation method is proposed to evaluate the contribution of variables using the historical information of the best overall fitness. Based on the contribution and the interaction information, a dynamic grouping strategy is conducted to construct the dynamic subcomponent that evolves in the next evolutionary period. The constructed subcomponents are different from each other, and therefore the required parameters to control the optimization of each subcomponent vary a lot in each evolutionary period. A stage-by-stage parameter adaptation strategy is proposed to adapt the optimizer to the dynamic optimization environment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art CC frameworks.

AB  - In this research, we report the empirical findings of a vignette study designed to examine how volitional computer users cope with information technology (IT) threats based on the technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT). We incorporate the construct of wishful thinking, an important form of emotion-focused coping behavior that is rarely studied, along with problem-focused coping into a research model to examine the interaction between the two coping approaches. The results reveal that wishful thinking weakens the effect of perceived avoidability on avoidance motivation. In turn, wishful thinking is positively affected by perceived threat and this effect is stronger when a user has low risk tolerance. Although perceived avoidability can reduce wishful thinking, its effect is fully mediated by perceived threat. This study highlights the important role of wishful thinking in affecting users' security behavior. It not only corroborates, but also extends the extant propositions of TTAT, thus making a significant contribution to IT security research and practice.

AB  - Holon is a powerful metaphor which captures the recursive structure of biological systems and the organization of their decision processes arranged at various granularity abstraction levels. From a computational intelligence perspective, a holon can be conceived as a goal-oriented community of lower-level holons led by more specific targets. Sub-holons co-operate on sub-problems that represent the source problem at a lower knowledge abstraction level. Such a (recursive) hierarchical organization constitutes the so-called holarchy. Holonic thinking is hence particularly suited for complex and intelligent systems modeling: in particular, its success has been proved in the field of Intelligent Manufacturing. Nevertheless, albeit hierarchical and granular thinking are two fundamental prerequisites in Software Engineering, the use of holonic thinking as software paradigm is still flawing in the literature at the moment. In this regard, the paper introduces the concept of ‘holonic granule’ as a novel software building-block for modeling complex granular systems. Prospective applications of holonic granule-based software models are then commented with particular emphasis to industrial automation and environmental monitoring settings.

AB  - Pattern recognition is one of the fundamental competencies associated with computational thinking and STEM education. Although much has been written to define computational thinking (CT), we argue that CT is a multi-faceted construct and specific aspects of CT (such as pattern recognition) should be examined. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of literature on pattern recognition to define pattern recognition as an aspect of computational thinking. The synthesis included the Engineering Village database (Compendex and INSPEC). We searched peer reviewed articles and the keywords, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and education. The initial search resulted in 208 articles. The screening of abstracts more closely resulted in 17 relevant articles, which were then read in detail by two researchers. The review of this pool resulted in two relevant articles, one with a focus on mathematics education and the other one in the context of medical education. Surprisingly there were no articles that examined pattern recognition as part of engineering or computer education. Further research examining specific aspects of CT is necessary.

AB  - A new class of genetic algorithms (GA) is presented. It is based on the idea of outsourcing, a popular trend in business. In a human based genetic algorithm (HBGA), all primary genetic operators are outsourced, i.e. delegated to external human agents. A totally outsourced genetic algorithm uses both human evaluation and the human ability of innovation. It is a multi-agent environment and the mediator of communication between multiple heterogenous agents. The advantage of this approach is its ability to address complex problems for which it is hard, not only to evaluate individuals, but to find a good representation for them. These qualities allow HBGA to process flows of information without knowledge of its particular structure and representation. The suggested conceptual approach can also be used as a general model and a way of thinking about different kinds of genetic algorithms.

It is of utmost importance to provide the students with comprehensive training and improve their competitiveness in their professional field by enhancing the skills of future generations to develop both the transversal and disciplinary competencies required that will allow them to become professionals who face challenges and opportunities in their future lives. Disciplinary competencies are the minimum necessary set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in their disciplinary field for students to perform successfully in different contexts. Traditionally, the evaluation of knowledge is used to evaluate the student's competencies in a course, and it does not usually reflect the degree of achievement of the student's competencies since these evaluations are based on specific topics and not on the acquisition of the competencies that the course should generate. The objective of this study is to design the evaluation criteria for the disciplinary competencies of Computer Science in students, as well as to measure their impact concerning the different subjects of their academic plan.

AB  - Many mathematics teachers produce original course materials with figures because their use enables students to comprehend mathematical objects. This paper presents a model for producing effective figures for use in course materials. LaTeX is often used to edit course materials and they often use computer algebra system (CAS) to insert graphical image files into the materials. We developed KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS to insert precise and expressive figures into a LaTeX document. After KETpic generates LaTeX-readable codes, the resultant figure is a monochrome, high-quality line drawing. Consequently, teachers can easily improve the quality of their materials. When they produce a figure using KETpic, they can perform mathematical operations as they consider combinations of KETpic commands as mathematical symbols. We designate this mathematical activity as symbolic thinking. By performing symbolic thinking, they need not be overly concerned about writing a program for CAS. Instead, they can concentrate on consideration of more important matters of cognition such as producing an effective figure. They require an advantageous environment in which they can easily perform symbolic thinking. This paper presents two sufficient conditions for this environment: (i) they produce new KETpic commands as the modularization of mathematical operations that they frequently use, and (ii) they create an original package of new KETpic commands. In this paper, we present some examples for these propositions using KETpic based on Scilab.

We develop and validate a hybrid systems dynamics and agent-based computational model using data over a 15 year period from the assembly of teams in the emerging scientific field of Oncofertility. We found that, when a new field emerges, team assembly is influenced by the reputation and seniority of the researchers, prior collaborators, prior collaborators' collaborators, and the prior popularity of an individual as a collaborator by all others. We also found that individuals are more likely to assemble into an Oncofertility team when there is a modicum of overlap across its global ecosystem of teams; the ecosystem is defined as the collection of teams that share members with other teams that share members with the Oncofertility team.

AB  - Nurturing programming talent early is crucial in today's digital world, especially in K-12 education, underscored by the rise of programming competitions for younger students. However, with limited research in programming talent search, discovering programming talent in primary schools posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, various test-based talent search tools have been utilized for programming talent identification, including the Computer Talent Search Test (CTST) and the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt). Game-based platforms like CodeCombat offer an engaging alternative to overcome this challenge. CodeCombat integrates game-based learning with programming education, allowing students to apply their computational thinking skills in an enjoyable context for learning Python. The study revealed a significant correlation between CodeCombat, CTST, and BCTt outcomes. This highlighted that CodeCombat emerged as a valuable platform for talent search, aligning seamlessly with the objectives of the test-based tools and suggesting its effectiveness in boosting programming learning motivation in primary school.

AB  - The anticipatory timing control in sensory-motor coupling is indispensable to generate coordinative movement among humans, however its cognitive mechanism still remains obscure. In this study we used synchronization tapping task as a model system, and negative asynchrony phenomenon where the tap onset precedes the stimulus onset was analyzed as an example of the anticipation. Especially, applying dual task method, the relationship between the anticipation mechanism and the higher brain function such as attention and working memory was investigated. The results revealed two types of anticipatory timing control. In the inter stimulus-onset interval (ISI) range of 450 to 1800 ms, automatic anticipation that is not affected by attentional resources was observed and was based on feed forward dynamics. In the 2400 to 3600 ms range, the anticipation showed trade-off relationship in the allocation of attentional resources. Magnitude of synchronization error (SE) between tap onset and stimulus onset in this region was scaled by the ISI and the feed back dynamics concerning ISI was suggested. Accordingly, anticipation in timing control was shown to be a dual processing between the attentional process and the embodied automatic process.

AB  - In this paper we show that, when dealing with genetic structures of cognition, Piaget's approach is the most convenient algebraic form of logic structure to use and which classical logic can be derived from. But the formal rationality provided by the derived “semantic squares” is not spontaneous at rational level, and therefore, should not be easy to learn for adults. This is the main reason why we need reliable and effective training tools to achieve full logic and predicative proficiency, like the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM). We present the basic considerations towards the development of computational, intelligent tutoring system (ITS), taking in focus the computational model for current reasoning fallacies based on Piaget-Klein Fourgroup and related EPM training tool to achieve predicative proficiency. EPM and ITS can also contribute to AI and cognitive informatics, helping to develop autonomous reasoning system for person-centered learning and training to predicative competence and decision making.

AB  - As more and more developed ICT devices appear more and more frequently, these become natural attributes of life for the contemporary “digital generation”. For the generation which grew up in the e-world, it was natural that their everyday activities were tied to the possibilities offered by the networks. These challenges could not leave the pedagogical science cold either. It tried to comply with the generation challenges from the very beginning. It tried to “borrow” those technical devices, theories and methods, which were already applied successfully by other fields of science, adjusting its own learning methods, teaching and learning models and learning environments to them. In our article, we try to draw a parallel between the system of engineering and pedagogy. Furthermore, we would like to map the new trends of pedagogy, which are possible on the basis of the logics of engineering.

AB  - This short paper aimed to investigate how young children as little computer engineers learned in an educational robotics project. Student participants were 11 third graders at one public elementary school in Taiwan. The project in an after-school learning program lasted for five weeks. During weekly learning session, each student needed to use one visual block programming called Ozoblockly to design action patterns for their robots (Ozobot). The study adopted a case study methodology to examine the specific learning scenario. The principal researcher used a participant observation method to observe students' learning behaviors, informal after-class interviews to collect students' learning responses, and a portfolio analysis approach to examine students' programming works. The findings showed that students might obtain a basic understanding of a computer engineer after the instructional intervention. Furthermore, some specific learning patterns from young children's programming process were identified.

AB  - Presents a scalable algorithm for short-range molecular dynamics which minimizes interprocessor communications at the expense of a modest computational redundancy. The method combines Verlet neighbor lists with coarse-grained cells. Each processing node is associated with a cubic volume of space and the particles it owns are those initially contained in the volume. Data structures for 'own' and 'visitor' particle coordinates are maintained in each node. Visitors are particles owned by one of the 26 neighboring cells but lying within an interaction range of a face. The Verlet neighbor list includes pointers to own-own and own-visitor interactions. To communicate, each of the 26 neighbor cells sends a corresponding block of particle coordinates using message-passing cells. The algorithms has the numerical properties of the standard serial Verlet method and is efficient for hundreds to thousands of particles per node allowing the simulation of large systems with millions of particles. Preliminary results on the new CM-5 supercomputer are described.<>

AB  - Supply chain network design is a critical strategic challenge that significantly influences operational efficiency and competitiveness in the global marketplace. This paper introduces Think4SCND, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that addresses the dynamic complexities of supply chain network design by integrating a Supply Chain Transformer Network with a Thinking Model. Our approach formulates the supply chain network design problem as a Markov Decision Process, developing an architecture capable of handling mixed discrete-continuous action spaces. The core innovation lies in the Thinking Model, which enhances the Supply Chain Transformer Network’s ability to reason about future states and evaluate decision sequences, enabling more informed and forward-looking decision-making. We propose an end-to-end training algorithm that effectively combines model-free reinforcement learning with model-based planning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Think4SCND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving near-optimal solutions with a fraction of the computational cost. The framework demonstrates superior adaptability to disruptions and strong generalization capabilities, successfully transferring knowledge from medium-sized problems to larger, unseen instances.

In previous teaching practice, virtual simulation platforms are often used as teaching aids, and the operational difficulty of the platforms may reduce students' interest in learning, thus lowering the learning effect. Therefore, based on the 5E teaching model, this study combines gamification elements with virtual simulation integrated learning to explore its effects on the three dimensions of students' learning goal attainment, computational thinking improvement, and autonomous learning improvement.

At the completion of the project it was realized that to address the complexity of a Smart Grid with vast numbers of intelligent connected devices and systems, computational intelligence techniques must move from top-down to the lowest levels of architectures, with interactive cooperation between smart components, each with a level of autonomy. The CS-SGVP team emphasized creative thought leadership and “blue sky” thinking to identify future Smart Grid operational visions and the role of computing to achieve these visions. The CS-SGVP team developed its visions using a three-tiered approach. Architectural concepts describe Smart Grid goals and characteristics, general grid types, as well as computing concepts considered common across grid types. Functional concepts describe how the grid will operate. Technological concepts describe the roles of certain technologies within the Smart Grid. The CS-SGVP expects that over the course of many years, various visions will come to fruition.

AB  - The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) first appeared a few decades ago. Today, by the ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the boost of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the advances in big data analytics, it is safe to say that IoT has evolved to a new concept called the Internet of Everything (IoE) or the Internet of All. IoE has four pillars, things, human, data, and processes, which render it as an inhomogeneous large-scale network. A crucial challenge of such a network is to develop management, analysis, and optimization policies that besides utility-maximizer machines, also take irrational humans into account. We discuss several networking applications in which appropriate modeling of human decision-making is vital. We then provide a brief review of computational models of human decision-making. Based on one such model, we develop a solution for a task offloading problem in fog computing and we analyze the implications of including humans in the loop.

AB  - Meditation has been shown to aid with the management of affective disorders through improving emotion regulation. Here we begin to develop a theory of meditation by creating a computational cognitive model of focused attention meditation. Our model was created within Prims, a derivative of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We implemented a model based on an extensive literature review of how the meditation experience unfolds over time. We then tested the Prims model in a sustained attention task, intending to capture a faculty that may be trained with meditation practice. The model was significantly better able to maintain focus after the meditation practice than before. These results agree qualitatively with empirical findings of a longitudinal study on the effects of meditation conducted in 2010. The central mechanism for increasing task relevant focus in the model seems to be a feedback loop. The meditation and mind-wandering processes reinforce themselves and weaken the other. However, this reinforcement is more dispersed in the more elaborate mind-wandering process, which causes it to decrease over time. We speculate that observed improvements in emotion regulation observed after meditation arise from the ability to maintain focus, because it allows the practitioner to avoid emotions spiraling out of control.

AB  - Opponent Modelling tries to predict the future actions of opponents, and is required to perform well in multiplayer games. There is a deep literature on learning an opponent model, but much less on how accurate such models must be to be useful. We investigate the sensitivity of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm (RHEA) to the accuracy of their modelling of the opponent in a simple Real-Time Strategy game. We find that in this domain RHEA is much more sensitive to the accuracy of an opponent model than MCTS. MCTS generally does better even with an inaccurate model, while this will degrade RHEA's performance. We show that faced with an unknown opponent and a low computational budget it is better not to use any explicit model with RHEA, and to model the opponent's actions within the tree as part of the MCTS algorithm.

AB  - This work-in-progress research paper presents the preliminary results of a study exploring the effectiveness of using computational notebooks to enhance student learning in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course for undergraduate Mechanical Engineering students. Our previous work has shown that students often face difficulties in grasping abstract concepts from mechanics of materials while simultaneously learning computational modeling. However, students recognized several advantages of using MATLAB for FEA compared to manual calculations, including significant time savings, increased efficiency, and reduced errors. Nevertheless, they also faced challenges, including a steep learning curve for MATLAB and concerns about how this limitation hinders their conceptual understanding. Despite these drawbacks, they recognized the importance and value of developing computational skills for their future careers. In this study, we extended the scaffolds and changed the sequence of activities to address the challenges the students faced in the previous iteration of our work. Specifically, we provided worked examples that students needed to use, self-explain, and modify before they engaged in programming from scratch. Also, after developing a basic understanding of how to implement FEA in MATLAB, the students used ChatGPT to generate a code that would do the same task. This activity required them to evaluate and refine automatically generated MATLAB code, as ChatGPT may provide alternative solutions that might not always work correctly. We explore three main topics to understand student experiences with and perceptions of this approach: (1) the value of using computational methods compared to manual completion for FEA; (2) the challenges and support of using MATLAB for FEA; and (3) the effectiveness of simulation tools to learn FEA. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) supporting student learning of intricate phenomena explored in mechanics of materials, like distribution of stress, and stiffness, and (2) fostering essential computational thinking skills through practical disciplinary coding experience. By implementing these elements, the study anticipates a substantial improvement in students' understanding of FEA principles and their ability to translate them into solutions for real-world engineering challenges.

AB  - Advanced mathematics is a fundamental subject in college education, essential for developing students’ analytical and problem-solving skills. It forms the basis for many advanced topics and is crucial for a well-rounded academic foundation. Mathematical modeling, on the other hand, is a powerful tool for addressing real-world problems by creating abstract models. It is widely applied in fields like economics, industry, medicine, and social sciences. With the rapid advancement of computer technology, mathematical modeling has evolved significantly. Tools like MATLAB have become essential for developing and analyzing complex models, enabling the resolution of intricate problems that are difficult to solve manually. The integration of computer technology into mathematical modeling enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of problem-solving.Given these advancements, it is crucial for colleges and universities to incorporate computer-based mathematical modeling into their curriculum. By integrating these techniques into advanced mathematics courses, educators can create a more cohesive learning experience that combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications. This approach not only improves the quality of mathematics education but also better prepares students to apply their mathematical skills to real-world challenges, equipping them for professional success in a rapidly changing world.

AB  - This paper presents a novel bilingual model modification approach to improve nonnative speech recognition accuracy when the variations of accented pronunciations occur. Each state of baseline nonnative acoustic model is modified with several candidate states from the auxiliary acoustic model, which is trained on speakers' mother language. State mapping criterion and n-best candidates are investigated, and different numbers of Gaussian mixtures of the auxiliary acoustic model are compared based on a grammar-constrained speech recognition system. Using this bilingual model modification approach, compared to the nonnative acoustic model which has already been well trained by adaptation technique MAP, the Phrase Error Rate further achieves a 5.83% relative reduction, while only a small relative increase on Real Time Factor occurs.

AB  - Systems thinking approaches are employed to construct a formal decision making methodology for equitably allocating water among competing users in a river basin when taking into account both the societal and physical systems aspects of the allocation problem. In particular, within the societal component of the decision problem, multiple participants, their multiple objectives, equity principles, and economic factors are considered, while the physical systems part reflects relevant hydrologic and environmental factors. The Cooperative Water Allocation Model (CWAM) incorporates these societal and physical systems concerns within the framework of a large-scale optimization program which is divided into two main steps. Firstly, water is allocated among users based on existing legal water rights regimes or agreements. Secondly, water and associated benefits are reallocated among stakeholders to maximize basin-wide welfare. CWAM is applied to the South Saskatchewan River Basin located in the Canadian province of Alberta to demonstrate how it can be conveniently applied to a water allocation system of systems problem.

AB  - Fundamentals of Computer is a compulsory course of non-majors in many universities of China. In this paper, we explore the reform on this course for two goals. One is to redesign the teaching content: from operation oriented to computational thinking oriented. Computational thinking is one of the most important ability for 21st century and has become the primary goal of computer foundation education. New content covers the basic principles of computer science as well as the fundamental ways of thinking and problem solving with computer. The second goal is to improve teaching methods by leveraging mobile technology. We propose the use of MIT App Inventor, which is a simple tool for creating mobile applications for Android. Students with no prior knowledge of programming can create entertaining and socially useful applications with App Inventor while practicing computational thinking.

AB  - Amongst the various open source educational software, the Modular Object Oriented Developmental Learning Environment (MOODLE) seems to be the most user friendly having numerous features. This paper aims at investigating the usefulness of digital technologies imparted into a blended learning model for engineering education. The role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a wider role in teaching-learning activities like, content creation, administrative, formative-summative assessments, student's performance tracking, trainings, knowledge management and knowledge organization. In addition, the technical features of ICT allow us to customize to meet the demands of an institution. Considering the recent major shifts in the learning paradigm, these innovations were deployed in an ongoing, real time basis in our educational campus. Technology based virtual learning approach was aimed at stimulating students' interest in learning engineering curriculum; consequently its effectiveness was statistically evaluated. Finally, this research report is aimed at summarizing the ways in which ICT is used, and how it creates new learning opportunities both online and off line.

AB  - Computer science is becoming ever increasingly important to our society. Computer science content has, however, not traditionally been considered a natural part of curricula for primary and secondary education. Computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at K-12 level entails. Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. In this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their K-12 education. The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. Computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. The most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school. A few countries have made it compulsory in both, while some countries have only introduced it in secondary school.

AB  - The flipped classroom model is gaining increasing attention in higher education, including engineering education. There are various types of models and contexts in which they are applied. Generalized research on the effectiveness of the flipped classroom is emerging, and results have been mixed. One such model is team-based learning (TBL) as originally developed by Larry Michaelsen in the late 1970s. TBL is a structured way to implement a flipped classroom approach, and has been shown to be successful in achieving deeper learning among the students. In this paper, we discuss our experience using the TBL methodology in a graduate computer engineering course on system level design of embedded systems. Specifically, we describe the course design, instructor experience adapting TBL for use in the course, including implementing an asynchronous online TBL process, and instructor reflections and student feedback on what worked well and what did not. We analyze the course content using the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior, and assess the effectiveness of our implementation in achieving deeper learning. Additionally, we report on student perception of the new course structure and their experience using TBL.

In this paper, we describe our experiences on design of project GridPSi, a grid-enabled PSE for physical simulation. GridPSi provides a rich suite of functions that facilitate the composition of computational scripts to automate physical simulations by design domain-specific templates for a verity of research fields. The generic functionality provided by it includes problem modeling, mesh file conversion, computational script generation, solution scheme specification and access to grid resources. GridPSi offers a simple interface that is intuitive to users in the human-PSE interactions and ways of thinking. Furthermore, we developed higher-level graphical components named PDE wizards that build upon the core functions to guide users through problem modeling process with minimum effort. By using Unicore as grid middleware, we are lowering the barriers to entry for users wishing to exploit grid technologies

AB  - Michigan Technological University is one of the nation's largest engineering schools (900+ first year students) and houses a large common first year engineering curriculum. The purpose of this curriculum is to introduce many of the fundamental components of engineering. One of these components is the use of modern computational and programming tools to solve engineering problems. This paper continues a long-term study that began in 2007 and focuses on student confidence with the use of computational tools. On the first day of class, students were surveyed on their proficiency with the use of spreadsheets. Students self reported levels of proficiency from expert to no experience. Students were then asked a simple question regarding a spreadsheet cell equation. Over three years only 16% of the students were correct, while 90% self ranked as familiar or better. A gender bias was noted as women under estimated their skills while men overestimated their own abilities. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge of gender confidence gaps. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for creating an assessment plan to identify the preparedness of incoming students and measure their skill at the end of the course.

AB  - There has been a well-documented and persistent drop in the number of women in computer science and engineering courses [1]. Young peoples' decisions about participation often start early and have been linked to particular experiences [2]. For some young people, these experiences are less than encouraging. In the US, high school computer science courses are overwhelmingly male dominated [3]. Schools serving minority students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often struggle to even offer such classes [4]. Even when opportunities exist, many girls and underrepresented populations face barriers such as negative stereotypes and dearth of role models and community [5]. The Digital Youth Divas program was created to address these issues through intentional design. The program is developed to trigger situational interest [6] in girls through a combination of community, project-based instruction, on- and offline learning spaces, and narrative stories. Triggered situational interest is critical as an opening to move on to subsequent phases that are more independent of environmental factors. Understanding potential effective triggers for girls, minorities, and youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds is critical to engaging such populations in STEM learning. (1) Community: Middle school girls interested in fashion and design are recruited, especially from areas that have traditionally been underserved. Adult mentors who are not engineers, but share cultural connections with the girls and have gone through curriculum and pedagogical training, attend to specific practices of encouraging, helping to troubleshoot, and developing community. (2) Project-based instruction: The program combines principles of fashion, design, and dance with the power and possibilities of electronic circuits and programming to develop interactive e-fashion projects and virtual programmed choreographies. Scaffolded challenges work through stages of design and computational thinking, including paper prototyping, implementation, feedback, and revision. (3) Integrated on and offline learning spaces: Girls work through projects in a shared physical space using supplied materials. An online system, iRemix, is the mechanism for independent work and leveling up. (4) Interactive narrative stories: Narratives can provide context that helps relate abstract concepts to real-world issues [7], increase motivation and positively contribute to girls' science identity [8], and provide focus for design by communicating tasks, specifically when readers can identify with the stories [9]. Compelling stories conveyed in text and multimedia (video, audio, images) is employed to engage middle school girls in activities involving computational thinking. The stories center on a group of middle school girls involved in the Digital Youth Divas program, and combines aspects of contemporary young adult fiction (mystery, social and emotional issues) with content, topics, and project work from the e-textiles and programming curricula. The interactive narratives unfold through the iRemix platform: girls launch narratives and at intervals are prompted to engage in project-based work. The girls solve challenges by submitting work online, and receive and respond to messages from characters. Our early exploratory research suggested that narratives prompted discussions of identity, and contributed to participant interest in the program content and motivation to engage in project work.

AB  - Think of a digital simulation as a computational device for which one must allocate three computational resources for computing: (a) the given inputs, (b) the outputs and (c) each state variable in the dynamics. This paper assigns these computational resources to guarantee a specified bound on response errors. We define the economical simulation problem (ESP) as designing the simulation of a stable linear system and distributing computational resources (wordlength) among the digital devices such that the computational cost (memory) is minimized without violating the required simulation accuracy. This problem is generally not convex because of the scaling constraint. By exploring the special structure of this joint optimization of the choice of the realizations and the computational resources to be applied, and under a scaling assumption, the ESP is converted to a convex problem. Numerical results are given which compare this method with existing approaches.

At the same time, their communication, collaboration, and team-building skills lack the necessary depth to succeed in the world of work. Alongside other technological improvements, Education 4.0 has proposed the introduction of new learning and teaching methods such as project, problem, and design-based approaches. In this comparative study, the project-based approach is presented. The aim of the research was to investigate the teamwork skills of engineering students. 177 students were interviewed about how each project team works together and which skills and competences are missing to succeed together. The results of the quantitative research show that self-assessment scores in all subsamples outperformed the assessment of teams. The results can be incorporated into a future teaching methodology framework for skills development.

AB  - The importance of change management is still under-emphasised in lean transformation because many people are not familiar with change management models. This may be an area that needs more attention in the future. The survey shows that there are professionals at all levels, but also where there are gaps. However, it gives hope that in the coming years these gaps will be filled and more effective lean transformations can be led. The main lessons from the survey can help to set priorities for the coming years. Those in the support phase are the least aware of the importance of a blame-free environment, which is a key factor for effective lean transformation. In the application phase, there is a clear lack of awareness of the Kanban system. The lack of knowledge of plant management is also consistent with the experience. This is also due to the fact that the development of lean was not always based on existing knowledge, but was promoted as a new method different from traditional practices.

AB  - Sentence group is mapped into contextual element, one of the four layers of linguistic conceptual space in the theory of hierarchical network of concepts (HNC). The contextual element is composed of three parts: domain, situation and background. The domain is extracted by merging sentences with the same or similar domain conceptual symbol, which comes from the symbols of conceptual primitives, the conceptual symbols of words, and the semantic chunks in a sentence. The conceptual framework of situation is filled with the right words or phrases, according to the knowledge of domain sentence categories, the sentence categories and semantic chunks. The experiments show that there are still many aspects to be improved, including the knowledge base, analyzing the semantic structures of sentences, and matching the conceptual symbols in different types.

In order to support change handling, product modeling in current product lifecycle management (PLM) system uses feature and contextual connection definitions to realize self-adaptive characteristics of product model. Actual problems with this model are identified and recent contributions to establish new modeling solutions are introduced in this paper. The main objectives are to enhance self adaptive characteristics of currently applied product models and to extend contextual connections to new features providing higher level knowledge representation capability. Open architecture PLM system representing latest product modeling principles and methods is considered as environment for the research, simulation, and implementation demanded by the proposed extension using new features and contexts.

AB  - A great deal of region-related concept detection algorithms have been proposed so far, but there are few of them concerning about the problem of mismatched regions at training and testing stages. In order to investigate the mismatch problem in region-related concept detection, we introduce three kinds of methods to annotate the datasets, and then conduct experiments on differently annotated training and testing datasets. We find from these experiments that the detection performance is the best when the regions of a region-related concept are well defined and matched during training and testing, or the detection performance will be decreased. Based on these observations, we propose a fusion scheme to combine the results of classifiers trained with datasets which are annotated by different methods. Experiments on Trecvid-2007 test corpus show that the proposed fusion scheme can obtain performance improvement up to 6~12%.

AB  - We have been running summer computing camps at the University of Limerick, Ireland, since 2010. The three-day camps are offered to boys and girls aged 14 and up. During the summer of 2015 we ran two computing camps where we focused on strategy development for the ChainReaction board game with the jABC workflow modelling framework for the first time. In this paper we describe the freely available software packages and the camp programme that we designed around them.

AB  - Among the 17 sustainable development goals specified by United Nations organization in 2015, goal four is the key for progress towards the achievement of all the other goals. However, studies show that this goal is yet to be achieved among African universities in terms of supervision due to inadequate availability of supervisors to their research students. Ambient learning approach promises to address the problem by allowing access to education services like research supervision at anytime, anywhere and anyhow. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted to assess its effectiveness towards achieving sustainable development goal four. The aim of this paper is to describe a model that illustrates how ambient learning systems can be combined with decision support tools to support evaluation of its effectiveness.

AB  - Volunteer computing (VC) or distributed computing projects are common in the citizen cyberscience (CCS) community and present extensive opportunities for scientists to make use of computing power donated by volunteers to undertake large-scale scientific computing tasks. VC is generally a noninteractive process for those contributing computing resources to a project, whereas volunteer thinking (VT) or distributed thinking allows volunteers to participate interactively in CCS projects to solve human computation tasks. In this paper, we describe the integration of three tools, the Virtual Atom Smasher (VAS) game developed by CERN, LiveQ, a job distribution middleware, and CitizenGrid, an online platform for hosting and providing computation to CCS projects. This integration demonstrates the combining of VC and VT to help address the scientific and educational goals of games like VAS. This paper introduces the three tools and provides details of the integration process along with further potential usage scenarios for the resulting platform.

AB  - Human activity naturally contains ambiguities and contradictions that cannot be solved mathematically or logically. We think that human intelligence is closely related to the use of language. Therefore, in order to achieve intelligent computing as human beings do, we need to realize the architecture in which language is used as an information medium on a computer. In this paper we study on the development of a travel consultation system based on the above architecture as an example of information processing in intelligent computing, and show how language functions in information processing.

AB  - One erroneous idea from Peruvian population is to think that for teaching technology concepts in public schools is very important the use of hardware, software, electricity or Internet. The truth is that exists lots of teaching methods for developing a computational thinking and these do not depend on the resources mentioned before. Children have demonstrated a big capacity for secure their knowledge if the teaching method is simple and didactic through games and recreational activities. For these reasons, we propose the use of unplugged activities, which do not require the use of computers and has the objective of promoting, clearing out and developing essentials concepts of computer science, as well as developing the computational thinking in kids through a funny and dynamic focus. In this way, they are going to be prepared to enter in a world where the computer science is expanding progressively in each area of daily life.

AB  - The application of “programming education” has become one of the future technological trends, and students with design backgrounds should also grasp this important development. In this study, the “AgilePoint NX” program course was established, and computational thinking was introduced into the course to guide students, through the image flow and low-code learning process, to carry out structured thinking and question speculation, and complete task exercises. This aims to teach design students to learn programming and computational thinking through a cloud-based low-code development platform with image processes and interdisciplinary learning processes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluate the learning effect through classroom learning observation, simple questionnaire survey, imagination scale, and other methods. Finally, the study found that in interdisciplinary programming learning, different factors lead to low learning effects of programming courses for design background students, resulting in different degrees of learning pain points and learning experiences. The power of imagination test is a tentative exploration of this research, but for the low-code development platform with fewer measurement data and biased towards procedural thinking, only predictive exploration has no significant data to show the specific impact on the programming learning process, only As a reference for interdisciplinary study.

AB  - The solution consists in creating a new curriculum for the topics of computing in schools that will focus on a didactic teaching so that students can develop computer thinking. It consists of 3 stages and each stage will focus on students of certain ages. The first stage corresponds to the grades from 1st grade to 2nd grade of primary school. The bases of computational thinking will be developed through dynamics and games, in this way children will not get bored and learn by playing. The second stage is aimed at students from 3rd grade to 6th grade. It consists in introducing the basic concepts of the computation and the use of Scratch once the computational thinking was developed when they were smaller. Finally, in the third stage the programming languages will be taught. This stage is developed throughout high school and will start with the Python language to finish with C ++.

AB  - Approximately 25 years have passed since the "sense-act-think" paradigm was advanced as the operational definition of a robot, and as a broad roadmap for robotics research. With the appearance of mobile robots that do real work in the real world, "communicate" has de facto been added to the list of functionalities that are essential features of robots. In keeping with the theme of the ROSE-2003 Workshop, this paper attempts to articulate and justify a set of intellectual and engineering challenges for 21 st century sensing and perception for robotics. It especially argues for examining the current and re-examining future roles for teleoperation, both as a practical route around the improbability that machine intelligence will equal human intelligence in the foreseeable future, and because it is apparent that sensor improvement is driven in large part by incremental advances in sensor-display design-and-test loops that are in turn driven by human factors governing perception.

These new technologies, ideas and approaches provide a new environment for researching and developing load balancing-oriented job scheduling system. Aiming at the hierarchical Grid model structure, following statistical thinking, this paper proposed a new task scheduling and resource allocation algorithm, which can not only increase the utilization of resources and system throughput, but also realize the load balancing within Grid systems. This algorithm consists of three main modules, they are load tracking module, job distributing module and load monitoring module. On the basis of having explained the functions of the different functional parts and the relationships between them, the corresponding pseudo-code algorithm are given. The results of simulative experiments show that the algorithm is effective.

AB  - Models of the cognitions used by engineering students to solve problems have always been a part of engineering education. Many, such as the engineering mechanics model (select free-body, draw vector diagram, write equilibrium equations, and solve equilibrium equations), have been part of the introduction of students to engineering topics for a long time. More recently, student problem-solving processes are being reexamined with an eye towards a deeper understanding of the student problem-solving process and developing new approaches to student problem-solving that develop engineering insight, conceptual knowledge, critical examination, and reflective thinking skills. Several of the more recent problem-solving models reported in the engineering and science education literature are dissected and compared in this paper. This comparison indicates that the motivation, definition, exploration, planning, execution, checking, and generalization model of Wankat and Oreovicz [1] is general enough to accommodate most of the elements (but, not necessarily all) of the other models. When properly implemented, this model also contributes to the development of the additional thinking skills required of modern engineers.

Thus, a trustfully background is fundamental requirement for provision of effective Ubiquitous Healthcare (UH) service. In this paper, the issue of Trust Evaluation of UH Providers when register UH environment is addressed. For that purpose a novel trust evaluation method is proposed, based on cloud theory, exploiting User Profile attributes. This theory mimics human thinking, regarding trust evaluation and captures fuzziness and randomness of this uncertain reasoning. Two case studies are investigated through simulation in MATLAB software, in order to verify the effectiveness of this novel method.

AB  - In the area of testing ICs, once an IC has failed a traditional go/no-go test, it needs to be tested further to determine if it can support error-tolerant operation for one or more high volume customers. This test must be very efficient since many chips will probably fail, and those that pass will be sold at a discount. We have already developed several efficient test procedures to support error-tolerance. One is a built-in self-test methodology that can sort chips into various bins based on their error-rate, just like resistors are sorted into 1%, 5% and 10% bins (Breuer, 2004). Digital systems designers have almost always focused on the concept of exact computational capability. Error-tolerant VLSI chips are a step in this direction using today's technologies, addressing current computational needs, and accepting present realities of scale and yield.

Being recognized as a campus with its high employability rate, this paper aims to describe how IT Del develops its computing curriculum in connection to its involvement in the Decart project. This paper first presents the Indonesia curriculum guideline. This is followed by the discussion of the development process of computing curriculum emphasizing three components: knowledge, skills, and dispositions. The last component is believed to be one of the important components aimed to prepare graduates to have 21st century skills. Then we relate them to the involvement of IT Del in the DECART project, funded by Erasmus Mundus. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that our existing curriculum development approach has been successful to build expected graduates' competence. This is expected to give an insight to define an agile curriculum framework to face the VUCA world as one of the objectives for the DECART project.

AB  - Although deep learning models are powerful among various applications, most deep learning models are still a black box, lacking verifiability and interpretability, which means the decision-making process that human beings cannot understand. Therefore, how to evaluate deep neural networks with explanations is still an urgent task. In this paper, we first propose a multi-semantic image recognition model, which enables human beings to understand the decision-making process of the neural network. Then, we presents a new evaluation index, which can quantitatively assess the model interpretability. We also comprehensively summarize the semantic information that affects the image classification results in the judgment process of neural networks. Finally, this paper also exhibits the relevant baseline performance with current state-of-the-art deep learning models.

AB  - A considerable body of research examines people's perceptions of the nature of science. There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.

AB  - Constructing a realistic systems biology of the mammalian cell will require us to describe molecular and cellular "parts", and to model and simulate their relationships in space and time. To date, most modelling and simulation has focused on temporally dynamic processes including pathways of gene regulation, metabolism and cellular signalling. A goal of the Visible Celltrade project is to integrate spatial as well as temporal models within a common data, computational and visualisation environment to support hypothesis-generation and hypothesis-testing by biologists and modellers. A unique feature of this project is our use of actual 3-D cellular structure data, reconstructed from medium-resolution confocal video microscopy and high-resolution electron tomography, to generate the matrix for our visualisation environment. Molecular sequence and protein structure data are obtained from distributed databases via web services. The Visible Celltrade has been designed as an e-research project and implements computational and data grid standards and technologies.

AB  - Problem-solving in the industry requires a broad perspective, adequate IT and engineering knowledge, open and creative thinking. This involves many areas that IT specialists and engineers need to acquire skill in finding and selecting problems, splitting complex issues into parts, exploring history, finding the right solution alternatives, selecting and optimizing, controlling the solution, and developing a conceptual plan. In our research, we aimed to examine one of the key competences of the 21st century, the problem-solving competence of engineering and IT higher education students. The research presented in the study is an element of a complex higher education competence test. Quantitative research has been done with an online measuring tool, a problem-solving questionnaire consisting of 16 items. The questions examine some elements of the problem-solving process.

AB  - Many important real-world decision making problems involve group interactions among individuals with purely informational externalities, such situations arise for example in jury deliberations, expert committees, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we will use the framework of iterated eliminations to model the decision problem as well as the thinking process of a Bayesian agent in a group decision/discussion scenario. We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency.

AB  - This research project aims to investigate, how young men and women differ regarding (1) their perceptions of Computer Science (CS) as a scientific discipline respectively as a professional field and (2) the experiences that had influenced their choice of major subject. For that purpose, we conducted a biographical study of CS freshmen at university. In total, 217 students (54 female, 163 male) participated on the survey. The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool. All these differences seem to influence the selection of the major subject of the students. They might explain the problem of low enrollment rates in Computer Science and the decreasing number of students in core Computer Science in comparison to the more interdisciplinary courses of study.

AB  - Speech summarization is typically performed by using a cascade of speech recognition and text summarization models. End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1.

AB  - The development agenda is always evolving, for instance the initiation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) from the millennium development goals (MDGs). On the other hand, rapid technological advances presents both challenges and opportunities to the development agenda. Learning is ever-required in this continuously changing environment. In addition, the global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience. The research is based on a total virtual learning experience of a masters' level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course comprised of students in South Africa, Myanmar, Finland and Germany at the University of Tampere. The research included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted constructive, collaborative and conversational learning. In addition, how well the learners' needs, such as, active, reflective and intentional learning are incorporated. The research seeks to promote context in terms of assessing the learning environment, that is, students' virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context should be embraced to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners' and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment. For example in this ICT4D 2.0 course, open learning diary, that is, online submission of students' diaries so that all the course's participants could review, was adopted to make learning more collaborative and conversional. Technological tools, such as, wiki and discussion form were also adopted to promote active and reflective learning in virtual environment. These pedagogical techniques and technological tools have to fit the learning context, thus for instance in the ICT4D class adoption was a result of the mid-course virtual learning review.

AB  - Although artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world quickly, training AI models still requires a lot of money and time. This is so because training an AI model needs a lot of data and processing power. A website that allows users to promote their AI model to other users and pay them for sharing their computer resources to help train it is one suggested solution to this problem. A blockchain-based strategy can be used to do this, and it offers numerous advantages such as lower expenses, effective resource pooling, task automation, precise remuneration, and a decrease in administrative overhead. AI models will thereby become more effective, more reasonably priced, and available to a larger variety of individuals and institutions.

AB  - The testability of equipment has become the key factor affecting equipment availability, and detracts from readiness and mission success. To overcome the current problems associated with the analysis of equipment testability, such as non-comprehensive failure mode coverage, low fault detection rate, and low fault location accuracy, this paper presents a system testability modeling and analysis method based on a summary of the results of device level failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA), which is developed according to the failure data of components and a hardware impact analysis. In particular, we present a mathematical multi-signal model, quantitative methods and mathematical models of system testability, and the implementation processes of system testability modeling. The proposed method allows the failure modes of a module to be obtained accurately and comprehensively. By functioning at the device level, the method provides good fault location accuracy, and improves the authenticity of system testability analysis results. Finally, the testability of an actual electronic system is conducted using CARMES, which is a widely used reliability engineering software. The results verify the effectiveness and authenticity of the presented method, which can also provide a reference for the testability modeling and analysis of follow-up system design.

When there is more than one agent or ldquoplayerrdquo, the logic of knowledge and belief play an important role. One is interested not only in each personpsilas knowledge and beliefs about substantive matters, but also in his knowledge and beliefs about the others. This paper explored the meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment in social interactions. First, each personpsilas knowledge and belief determines the interactive structure, which can be computer-aided calculation. Second, the process of interactions is dynamic, the assessment needs an open interactive environment to analyze and understand the situation, which is human-computer symbiotic. Third, these interactions are supported by the data and information processing algorithm and models. Interactive structure aided by computer, human-computer symbiotic open interactive environment, data and information processing algorithm and models constitute meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment.

AB  - With quick upgrading of knowledge and high demand for all-round talents at the age of information, the integration of computer multimedia into college English course has altered traditional teaching model. The teaching focus is converted to learning process from content; teacher becomes the organizer and manager of class, the director and supervisor of students instead of the lecturer; students become active and autonomous learners instead of passive receivers. Meanwhile, their collaborative skills and communication styles are improved in the so-called computer-assist teaching model. All in all, this student-centered interactive environment contributes to the improvement of the students' comprehensive English skills. The present authors intend to compare the two models, put forward concrete methods to apply this computer-assist teaching model to college English teaching and some constructive suggestions to the improvement of this new model.

AB  - Although there have been many advances in end-user programming environments, recent empirical studies report that programming still remains difficult for end-users. We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.

AB  - This paper presents a graph processing based traffic estimation system, GPTE, which is able to achieve high accuracy and high scalability to support city scale traffic estimation. GPTE benefits from its non-linear traffic correlation modeling and the graph-parallel processing framework built on clustered machines. By representing the road network as a property graph, GPTE decomposes the numerous computations involved in non-linear models to vertices and performs traffic estimation via neural network modeling and iterative information propagation. This paper presents our experiences in designing and implementing GPTE on top of the Spark, an emerging cluster computing framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data input from Singapore's transport authority. Experimental results show that GPTE achieves as high as 88 percent accuracy in traffic estimation and up to 8× performance gain in computation efficiency with the optimization techniques applied. Comparison study demonstrates that GPTE outperforms the baseline solutions by 34 percent on accuracy and 46 percent on processing time.

AB  - This paper scrutinizes the structure of jump-controlled LFSRs for resistance against generalized correlation attack based upon Constrained Levenshtein Distance(CLD) measure. It proves that for a given number of cipher text bits, CLD computation is independent of Jump index. However, based upon the inherent relation between the jump index and deletion rate, it is argued that structures utilizing primitive polynomials with large values of jump indices are relatively safer against generalized correlation attack when compared with their counterparts. The paper also presents a novel recursive algorithm for efficient computation of CLD for jump controlled structures and another algorithm to defeat the complexity induced due to high deletion rates.

AB  - Open-source research software plays a central role in accelerating advances in science and engineering. Its increasing significance, however, incentivizes malicious actors to attack that software and compromise the systems on which it runs, undermining the free and open exchange of trustworthy research codes. In the world of conventional software development, there has been a shift towards integrating security as early as possible in the development process to guard against malicious activity. Given the potential risks at hand, developers of research software must consider how to do the same across the research software lifecycle. This editorial argues for the need to unite diverse forms of expertise in scientific computing and software security to address these challenges and outlines a roadmap for future work in this space.

AB  - In college life, pressure is the main cause of student suicides, highlighting a significant societal and academic challenge that demands urgent attention for early detection systems and support mechanisms. Addressing this issue proactively is crucial. To tackle this, we introduce machine learning models designed to identify suicidal tendencies in students. These models analyze various data points such as depression levels and experiences of discrimination to predict suicide risk levels—high, medium, or low, in the near future. By using predictive analytics, our approach aims to identify those in need so that they can receive the necessary support promptly, thereby reducing the risk of student suicides and promoting a safer, more supportive environment in academic institutions.

AB  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made remarkable advances across various domains, capturing the interest of researchers, also in the fields of signal processing and speech enhancement (SE). This growing of attention has led to numerous studies focusing on developing and improving models for SE. One of the persistent challenges in the area is in designing a lightweight model (in terms of memory and computation requirements) that still delivers satisfactory results in terms of sound quality. In this paper, we present a lightweight, DNN-based SE model that offers significantly less computations than the current state-of-the-art SE models. By following a step-by-step approach, we re-evaluate the impact of various parts of typical SE models revealing the trade-offs between speech quality and computational costs. Assuming a single-core, 200MHz microcontroller device, our SE model can achieve real-time SE performance (less than 3M Multiply-Accumulate operations, MACs) with a small degradation in SE capabilities compared to state-of-the-art SE models.

AB  - Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, but evaluating their quality remains an open challenge. Existing automated metrics like FID are unable to fully capture generation performance across both objective fidelity and subjective aesthetic attributes important to human perception. This paper conducts an extensive review of the literature on GAN evaluation methodology. Key limitations of current approaches are analyzed through a discussion of popular metrics and their inability to predict human judgment comprehensively. To address this, a novel hybrid evaluation model is proposed that combines automated scores with human ratings to provide a more balanced assessment. A pilot study demonstrates the hybrid metric can predict human response more accurately.

AB  - Mathematics is one of the most difficult courses to study for engineering students. In addition, effective communication, teamwork, and problem solving are important skills for graduate engineers in their professional work. This study proposes Creative Problem Solving as a framework to improve the way engineering students learn mathematics and support their critical problem solving, communication, and team working skills. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using creative problem solving skills through blended learning environment as seen from an Engineering Mathematics students' perspective. First year undergraduate students participated in an experimental group where instruction was provided in a blended learning format using a creative problem solving approach. The lecturer then used face-to-face instruction on the same subject to a control group. Results indicate that from the perspective of the students in the experimental group, the ability to utilize creative problem solving skills is the most important skill set when learning Engineering Mathematics.

AB  - Decision makers need capabilities to quickly model and effectively assess consequences of actions and reactions in crisis de-escalation environments. The creation and what-if exercising of such models has traditionally had onerous resource requirements. This research demonstrates fast and viable ways to build such models in operational environments. Through social network extraction from texts, network analytics to identify key actors, and then simulation to assess alternative interventions, advisors can support practicing and execution of crisis de-escalation activities. We describe how we used this approach as part of a scenario-driven modeling effort. We demonstrate the strength of moving from data to models and the advantages of data-driven simulation, which allow for iterative refinement. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of this approach and anticipated future work.

AB  - The information society is a reality nowadays, and computational thinking has become a relevant competence for everybody, regardless of age, social status, and primary activity. Information society is everywhere in contemporary life, and algorithmic thinking represents a significant competency for individuals, irrespective of their educational background and social condition. Developing and applying programming competencies represents a high-value know-how ability. Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one. The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions. This work shows the application of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino in non-WEIRD contexts and, during the pandemic time, demonstrates the relevance of online education. The results show that developing programming competencies with Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino motivated students’ autonomy and motivation for learning regardless of their education level and status. Those results encourage us to continue using Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino to develop programming competencies without considering age and education level.

Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end-users. More recent approaches include visual programming with a drag-and-drop style of programming that makes it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges.

AB  - In the Northern Appalachian region around Pittsburgh, PA, many high schools do not have computer science courses, so students are not introduced to this critical subject that is needed for most technical career paths. Our unique strategy is to invite current high school science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers, in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Maryland, to participate in 3 summer workshops showing how to incorporate computing concepts into existing STEM courses. By working with teachers on how to assimilate programming and computational thinking into their classrooms we will effectively reach a large population of students in areas where computer science classes are not available. In this paper, we outline the current state of the project and some of the data we have collected. Future goals for this project include performing a rigorous evaluation of teacher impact and developing the workshop materials for wider dissemination.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been integrated into K-12 curricula globally, and coding has been the main vehicle in CT education. While great effort has been made in exploring cognitive effect of coding, limited has been done in attitudinal aspects. To bridge this gap, this study validated the existing Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS) in Chinese context and use the scale to explore how students perceived coding. Also, the association between coding attitude and CT performance was investigated. A total of 217 elementary students were involved. Psychometric qualities of ESCAS (Chinese) were examined, and the effect of coding attitudes on CT cognitive performance was analyzed with linear regression. Results showed that ESCAS (Chinese) was a valid and reliable attitudinal scale, and coding interest could predict CT performance. Future directions for the study were discussed.

AB  - This paper presents the initial results of a research that aims to evaluate the contribution of the Scratch visual programming language in the development of computational thinking in comparison to the use of pseudocode. The comparison scenario was the teaching of programming logic for higher education students of the Physics course. The research was outlined with the methodology of action research, allowing the evaluation of the use of language at the end of the approach of each content delivered during the research. The presented results refer to the approach of two contents, of the four established for the conclusion of the research. The steps of approaching each content were initiated with the application of the diagnostic evaluation, and finalized with the evaluation of performance. The results indicate a progression in knowledge about programming logic. In this way, it was possible to verify that the use of the Scratch language contributed to the learning of programming logic.

In this paper, we aim to develop a web-based learning environment for STEAM-blended programming education. The proposed system can provide the learning materials of JavaScript that can easily carry out STEAM education at educational institutions. To effectively realize STEAM-blended programming education, visual programming is useful. Therefore, first, we will examine the learning effectiveness of visual programming. Next, we will develop a web-based programming learning support system based on "Mathematics" learning with JavaScript. After the above, the concept of STEAM-blended learning material using LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is shown.

AB  - With the various social services such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, many kind of bit data types are exponentially increasing. Therefore, people have difficulties to find the sub-optimal service among the overflow data in Internet. In education area, new trend with various ICT tools such as YouTube, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics) supportive computational thinking software is famous. In this paper, we propose YouTube aware personalized recommender system for future ICT education. It is a technique to automatically rank high - visibility channels and videos in YouTube based on the personalized learning topic. To do this, we analyze the relevance of statistics such as views, likes, subscribers, and comments in YouTube, and use the R programming language with the rvest, ggplot2, stringr packages and the Chrome extension called SelectorGadget for direct data crawling. Initial experiments confirmed the possibility of the proposed technique and confirmed the possibility of extension.

AB  - Microsoft's Kodu is a visual programming environment for children inspired by robotics rule-based formalism to specify behaviors. The reactive nature of this approach means that systems just react to what they are currently sensing, they do not need to have a perfect model of the world, and they can easily respond to external changes in the world. This resilience makes behavior-based systems perfect for real world robotics use. When developers chose this approach for Kodu, the hope was that this resilience would help minimize the potential frustration of young users. This paper introduces the Kodu developers' strategy, results and future plans in developing a user-friendly programming environment that successfully introduces children in a fun and easy way to the fundamental concepts of computer science and computational thinking.

AB  - The teaching of programming in primary and secondary education has once again revealed the heterogeneity of the ways in which students learn and instructors teach such a capability. Language barriers and technological skills of the involved people are some of the factors that affect the usability and usefulness of educational programming environments. This article presents a gamified programming environment, called Damo's Quest, that supports middle school instructors while they teach programming to students who have little access to computer technology and proficiency in English language. The platform offers a gamified-educational experience, in which students must deal with challenges in fantasy stories (in virtual worlds) by programming various solutions. The usability and perceived usefulness of the first version of this tool have been evaluated by two researchers, who are experts in computational thinking. Although preliminary, the results are highly encouraging.

AB  - Learning programming language syntax is considered an obstacle in programming education. However, we believe it is an overlooked opportunity to exploit obvious synergies with Math. As evidenced around the world, middle and high school students know the syntax required to compute simple expressions, without previous exposure to programming languages. We make the case for an “expressions first” approach to facilitate the development of computational thinking. Our approach has the benefit of integrating directly with Math, which in turn reinforces the teaching of other STEM subjects as well as non-STEM ones. We report early results of an ongoing trial using a visual computing environment that supports this approach.

AB  - The subject of the computability of the mind introduces complex philosophical, ethical, and technical issues. That aside, this topic draws us in to the nature of algorithms. We are surrounded by algorithms; much of the history of computing is also the history of the advance of algorithms. For the public, algorithms are part of computing's self-made mystery, but to understand their nature is an important part of computational thinking. The Web extra at http://youtu.be/Lm5IRxWk4AQ is an audio podcast of author Grady Booch reading his On Computing column, in which he introduces the complex philosophical, ethical, and technical issues associated with the idea that the mind can be understood as a computer.

AB  - The term "Modern Art Teaching and Evaluation Model" describes the systematic incorporation of creative practices, methods, and experiences into traditional academic curricula in order to improve student achievement across the curriculum. The design thinking process and visual thinking tactics are two of the most popular methods. blockchain technology is up to the task of solving problems plaguing the higher education system and society as a whole. The blockchain's many benefits include less expensive transactions due to less time spent checking, controlling, and verifying data, as well as the presence of decentralized open data and the absence of forgeries and unsafe storing of information. The purpose of this study is to analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of using blockchain technology in education, as well as the effects that this technology may have on the future of this sector. Although its rapid development, blockchain (BC) has not yet been widely included into the education of contemporary art. The purpose of this paper is to develop strategies for integrating BC into 21st-century art instruction. After examining how BC technologies are currently being utilized within the realm of contemporary art education, the writers assessed the issues associated with their utilization. As a result, three approaches to promoting BC facets of contemporary art learning were developed: bolstering the malleability of BC-based modern art learning, strengthening the innovative three education of art learning, and enhancing the recent art background and ambience of BC-based modern art learning. In this research, modern art education to be provided via a blockchain-based system (BC-MAT) is discussed to improve the student performance. Concurrently, a productivity analysis strategy using analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) and grey grouping was developed to assess BC's impact on today's art classrooms. The BC-MAT has numerous applications and can be used to determine how BC has affected modern art education. The simulation results demonstrate the system's superior performance in precision, accuracy, efficiency, productivity, learning score, and student performance score.

AB  - The jigsaw pedagogy as a student-centered instructional approach has been successfully applied in information technology classrooms, but there is a lack of empirical research on the effectiveness of jigsaw pedagogy in unplugged environments. Therefore, this study combined the jigsaw pedagogy with unplugged activities and verified the teaching effect of such a combination through randomized group experiments. The results of the study showed that the combination of the jigsaw pedagogy and the unplugged activities was more conducive to promoting students' motivation and the development of computational thinking than the unplugged activity alone. Drawing upon the research findings, this study concluded with several implications for teachers to reform information technology classrooms in unplugged environments.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a crucial 21st-century skill, and its integration into K–12 education underscores the need for effective assessment tools. Although there are existing tools to measure CT practices, improvements can be made in terms of their assessment formats and data analysis methods. To address this gap, this study develops Critters Puzzle (CP), a game-based assessment tool aimed at measuring primary school students’ CT practices, specifically abstraction skills. Based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, 12 progressively challenging tasks were developed. To ensure the content validity of the tool, validation was put forward involving expert review and students’ cognitive interviews. Twenty-two experts were invited to review the appropriateness of the measurement and seven students (aged 6–10) were invited for interviews to evaluate the usability of the platform and its effectiveness as an assessment tool. Results indicated that the game is engaging, understandable, and appropriately challenging for students, and several modifications were made to the game based on the feedback from experts and interviewees. Future research will involve empirical studies to validate the game's psychometric properties, including its reliability and validity, as an assessment tool for CT practices.

AB  - When the classical theory of problem solving is put into practice, a sequence of operator applications must be found that transforms an initial problem state into a goal state. This is equivalent to finding a path through the graph of possible problem states from an initial node to a goal node. The search is usually conducted by an algorithm or by a human through an iterative process of selecting and applying operators to states found so far. Here, I demonstrate examples of searching in problem spaces via interactive drawing. The demonstrations help to elucidate issues in the design of new problem-solving affordances that may enhance the abilities of human solvers to understand and solve problems. This opens up new ways to conceptualize the process of solving problems, and it suggests new ways to teach a form of computational thinking.

AB  - Personalized learning is a teaching method that tailors learning to each student's specific talents, requirements, abilities, and preferences in order to foster entrepreneurial skills. In personalized education, each student is given a curriculum based on what they already know and how well they understand. To achieve its rapid and productive activity, a large-scale data analysis model for tracking the creative and entrepreneurial skills of college students is dependent on the balance and synergy of aspects such as different learning, finance, and institutional frameworks. As a result, in this research, a Big Data-assisted Thinking Skill Analysis Model (BD-TSAM) is presented to analyze students' innovative thinking skills and improve entrepreneurial skills through tailored education. This study creates a sophisticated and varied learning resource that continuously records and analyses student data. It provides tailored training, personalized learning, and dependable real-time services through technical support that uses big data to increase Entrepreneurship abilities. BD-TSAM enhances students' distinctive social and autonomous entrepreneurship learning by providing adaptive learning services. BD-TSAM intelligently creates a learning paradigm that is appropriate for each student and actually implements tailored learning for instilling entrepreneurial abilities. Comparing the suggested BD-TSAM model to other models already in use, the experimental results demonstrate that it increases the student learning rate by 94.6%, assessment rate by 95.2%, F-measure ratio by 96.6%, student performance ratio by 98.1%, decision-making rate by 99.1%, and employment ratio by 98.9%.

The project targets a mixed student population from urban, low-income settings. Based on the project's first-year results, the paper proposes significant changes that will be implemented in the project's second year. These changes include a competency-based education curriculum in which students' IT knowledge and skills can be assessed in a way that three college course credits can be awarded to students who are still in high schools, a 12-hour graduate certificate program that prepares both in- and pre-service teachers to teach college IT courses for University of Cincinnati at their high schools through an Ohio College Credit Plus program, and a more concentrated research in computational thinking, which has been brought up for national attention and recognized as one of the essential competencies among Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics disciplines.

AB  - This paper presents the development and use of empathy interviews at Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD) which is the fifth largest school district in the state. At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.

AB  - Teachers living and working in rural areas in the United States often lack access to high-quality professional development (PD) opportunities. As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.

AB  - This paper investigates how to provide meaningful scaffolding to bachelor humanities students, to enabled them to acquire Computational Thinking (CT) technical skills, and in particular basic programming competences. Two of the authors have been involved in the re-design, implementation and execution of a basic programming and CT course, offered to first-semester students as part of the Information science, IT and interaction design bachelor program, at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The central problem we faced in restructuring our introductory course, was finding a game genre that could support creative coding for beginners, be motivational and recognizable by the students, and would work with our use-modify-create learning approach. Our findings suggest that point-and-click games are an effective way to provide scaffolding and ease non-technical students into P5 programming. The genre has good expressive power, and the students were motivated because they recognized and could relate to the games they worked on. Future work will address students’ problems with scaling up the point-and-click games.

AB  - A key strategy for bringing computer science (CS) education to all students is the integration of computational thinking (CT) into core curriculum in elementary school. But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All.

AB  - Although, Unified Modeling Language (UML) has become a de-facto standard for design and specification of object oriented systems but its structures being semi-formal in nature have various disadvantages. The UML diagrams lack with defining semantics of the functionality of a system to be developed. Automata theory and formal methods are proved powerful at requirement specification, modeling, design and test case generation. To address and realize the benefits of liking UML, automata and formal methods, our project on "formalization of UML diagrams" is in progress. This paper is continuation of the same project in which behavior diagrams namely use case, activity and state diagrams are selected for critical analysis and possible improvements. Advantages, disadvantages and limitations of the diagrams are addressed. Finally, a treatment is suggested to link UML diagrams with nondeterministic and parallel finite automata to enhance modeling power of UML for facilitating the software development procedures.

AB  - From the philosophical point of view, granular computing (GrC) attempts to abstract and formalize the way of human cognition to extract a structured thinking mode. Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have a strong formal description and fuzzy reasoning abilities, which align with human cognitive thinking. However, the traditional FPNs are challenging to describe the following problems: formally expressing the transformation relations between information granules and information granule levels, and then carrying out formal reasoning and decision making based on cognitive thinking mode. This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules. Finally, a cognitive reasoning and decision-making model for the formal description of attribute information granules based on the new FPN is constructed, and the proposed case study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.

AB  - Can computers have intuition and insights, and be creative? Neurocognitive models inspired by the putative processes in the brain show that these mysterious features are a consequence of information processing in complex networks. Intuition is manifested in categorization based on evaluation of similarity, when decision borders are too complex to be reduced to logical rules. It is also manifested in heuristic reasoning based on partial observations, where network activity selects only those paths that may lead to solution, excluding all bad moves. Insight results from reasoning at the higher, non-verbal level of abstraction that comes from involvement of the right hemisphere networks forming large "linguistic receptive fields." Three factors are essential for creativity in invention of novel words: knowledge of word morphology captured in network connections, imagination constrained by this knowledge, and filtering of results that selects the most interesting novel words. These principles have been implemented using a simple correlation-based algorithm for auto-associative memory. Results are surprisingly similar to those created by humans.

AB  - The Collaborative Process to Align Computing Education with Engineering Workforce Needs (CPACE) team developed a partnership among various stakeholders to identify the computational skills that are essential for a globally competitive engineering workforce. Our goal is to redesign the role of computing within the engineering programs at Michigan State University (MSU) and Lansing Community College (LCC) to develop computational competencies - informed by industry needs - by infusing computational learning opportunities into the undergraduate engineering curriculum. In this paper we summarize the process that we used to translate our research findings about the computational competencies needs in the engineering workplace into fundamental computer science (CS) concepts that can be used in curricular implementation. We also discuss the initial phase of our curricular implementation strategy in two disciplinary engineering programs at MSU and transfer programs at LCC.

AB  - This article constitutes an effort to gain insights into the nature of creativity and its mechanisms leading to creative solutions to problems. This article claims that reflection constitutes the underlying mechanism, serving as a catalyst for creativity. A total of five experiments is presented, incurred in industrial and academic research environments and pedagogical settings, that demonstrate the occurrence of creativity, deliberately triggered by reflection. The key contribution of this article is that, although the exact definition of creativity continues to elude us, two mechanisms have been uncovered that are potentially useful in triggering creativity, at will, in ordinary scientific and engineering personnel to achieve quantum leaps in our knowledge and achievement. Reflection plays a key, catalytic role in both of these mechanisms and also appears to underlie the inner workings of Nature.

AB  - The focus of this paper is on the time dependent availability modeling and analysis of repairable multi component systems. Analytical techniques become very complicated and unrealistic especially for modern complex systems. There have been attempts in the literature to evolve more realistic techniques using simulation approach for availability analysis of systems. This paper proposes a hybrid approach called as Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach which combines the Markov approach with system dynamics simulation approach for the time dependent availability analysis and to study the dynamic behavior of systems. To the best of the authors' knowledge, in the published literature the authors generally assume that repairable systems reach their steady state when operational time reaches infinity. However, in practical situations it is important to know at what time the steady state begins. Therefore, another objective of this paper is to evaluate the time at which repairable multi component systems reach their steady state of operations. The proposed framework is illustrated for multi component systems such as a three component system with one component on standby with a numerical example. The results of the simulation when compared with that obtained by traditional Markov analysis clearly validate the Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach as an alternative approach for the time dependent availability analysis.

AB  - Although recent approaches to combine machine learning (ML) enhanced models and adaptive model selections using the built models became popular in many areas, however, there could be crucial pitfalls of built models in terms of 1) feature extraction and importance, 2) unbalanced datasets and 3) different types of ML estimators. In this case study using the ImageNet dataset, we thoroughly investigate the effects and possible pitfalls of features, datasets, and ML estimators for adaptive model selection of CNN inference network models targeting embedded systems. Based on the comprehensive results and analysis, we summarize opportunistic alternatives to minimize the pitfalls in the model building phase using more accurate feature extraction algorithms, various datasets in balance and size, and different types of interpretable (explaining important features) and black-box models.

AB  - We propose a new algorithm for the online supervisory control of partially observed discrete event systems. This algorithm is a parallel/distributed version of the online algorithm VLP-PO that we proposed in prior work. The situation under consideration in this paper is that of a system whose structure can be expressed as the shuffle of three state machines G/sub 1/, G/sub 12/, and G/sub 2/ (with disjoint event sets), where G/sub 12/ is to be interpreted as a common interface between the two system components G/sub 1/ and G/sub 2/. The legal language, denoted K, is global, but it can also be expressed as the parallel composition of two languages, K/sup 1//spl par/K/sup 2/, where K/sup i//spl sube/L(G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/), i=1,2. There are two communicating agents that simultaneously run (online) identical versions of the algorithm but on different models and legal languages: agent i, i=1, 2, operates on subsystem G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/ and legal language K/sup i/. We show that this scheme achieves the same behavior as the sequential VLP-PO algorithm, but at a total execution complexity that is significantly lower; this algorithm generates maximal observable and controllable sublanguages of the given legal language K.<>

AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a key resource for the study of brain function, and the interaction between computer and machine through EEG has become a new computer interaction mode. This project intends to study the EEG - computer interaction model based on facial expression. A neural cluster model based on neural network was used to model the mechanism of facial emotions-induced EEG. The EEG activity induced by facial emotion and its spectral characteristics were obtained. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of emotion-driven EEG, the analysis and recognition algorithm of EEG stimulated by expression is studied by combining wavelet with ANN model. The simulation results show that the correct rate of EEG recognition based on neural network is 88.69%. The recognition accuracy of BP neural network is 76.3%, and its convergence speed is also improved. The experimental results show that this method is an effective method for EEG recognition.

AB  - Trying to be effective (no matter who exactly and in what field) a person face the problem which inevitably destroys all our attempts to easily get to a desired goal. The problem is the existence of some insuperable barriers for our mind, another words barriers for principles of thinking. They are our clue and main reason for research. Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture. We start to express our thoughts in a language of mathematics, developing an apparatus for our Spatial Theory of Mind, suitable to represent processes and infrastructure of thinking. We use abstract algebra and stay invariant in relation to the nature of objects.

AB  - Knowledge bases are a fundamental platform for knowledge acquisition, retaining, retrieval, reasoning and generation across machine learning, natural language processing and computational intelligence. The mathematical model of formal concepts is centric in knowledge bases for modeling the basic unit of human knowledge and thinking threads. This paper presents the design and implementation of a cognitive knowledge base. The structure of the knowledge base is created as a dynamic concept network mimicking human knowledge represented in the brain. The knowledge base enables a set of novel knowledge manipulations for machine learning such as knowledge acquisition, access, analysis, refinement, fusion and system maintenance. Experimental results demonstrate the performance and efficiency of the implementation of the generic knowledge base for cognitive robots and machine learning systems.

AB  - The wall between computer science and electrical engineering has kept the potential of embedded systems at bay. It is time to build a new scientific foundation with embedded systems design as the cornerstone, which will ensure a systematic and even-handed integration of the two fields. The embedded systems design problem certainly raises technology questions, but more important, it requires building a new scientific foundation that will systematically and even-handedly integrate computation and physicality from the bottom up. Support for this foundation will require enriching computer science paradigms to encompass models and methods traditionally found in electrical engineering.

AB  - In the competitive economy of the 21st century, innovation and the attitude to innovation are key factors. The depletion of traditional natural resources in today’s fast-changing world has virtually eliminated the former engine of economic growth, and a new approach is needed to enable economic actors to cope with the new environment. New solutions are the only way to overcome the anomaly of natural resources. It is essential that all economic actors, from micro to large enterprises, can play their part in this process. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the conditions are created in the near future to promote and stimulate innovation. The aim of this study is to present the Hungarian SME sector’s view on the factors that stimulate innovation, assessing the potential characteristics that can contribute to these processes and behaviours.

AB  - This paper introduces a method for better communication between collaborating engineers and between engineer and entity generation processes at the definition of products in modeling systems. The authors recognized the importance of correct human-computer- human communication by using of product model as a special medium for engineers. In order to establish a product model that is appropriate for this purpose, they integrated all influencing effects on a product in an influencing space. In order to record content of influencing by engineers and other influencing persons, authorities, etc., the currently prevailing information based product model is completed by representation of information content. This paper emphasizes some relevant issues of information content. Definition of this contents starts from modeling of human intent. Intent model is consists of information about the owner of an intent, characteristics of that intent, and representation of content of intent in some form of knowledge. Information content is organized in the interconnected intent, behavior, and decision spaces. In a hierarchical system, intent space is at the highest and decision space is at the lowest level hierarchy assuring human intent based automation of decision making on engineering object in an improved product model.

AB  - Advanced engineering applies model space for the development complete and consistent description of product objects and structures. Description of parts and units of products have been completed by related objects such as results of analyses, interacting humans, equipment control programs, rules, and so on. Humans define these objects by using of contextual connections. Considering current product modeling, the next step of development is application of achievements from the area of intelligent computing at the definition of engineering objects in product models. This paper introduces a method for the application of knowledge based decision making in order to replace the conventional direct definition of engineering objects in model based product development. The authors developed a new modeling method on the basis of their earlier proposed concept of information content. In this paper, they introduce this modeling method and detail its application in the form of an extension to the classical model space that is suitable for control of engineering object definition through a contextual chain starting from influencing humans.

AB  - Recent developments in engineering produced a new technology for information intensive environment. A definite part of the physical world, typically a product and its operating environment is described in a computer system for a virtual space in order to data management during development, analysis, production, marketing, support, and recycling. One of the recent researches by the authors of this paper focuses to communication between human and engineering virtual space in order to enhance human control. In this paper, a new method is characterized that was proposed by the authors as a contribution to information intensive engineering environments. Main purpose of the proposed method is to realize a consistent model, where decisions are done strictly according to the human communicated control information, while this information is stored for the related engineering objects in the product model and control actions are coordinated.

AB  - According to Henry Jenkins, Transmedia storytelling is defined as "Transmedia storytelling (TMS) represents a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story." (Jenkins 2007) In recent years, this technique is becoming popular in Europe and America. A creator needs to combine "Flow of story" and "Story experience" at a stage of planning a TMS project. Also, it is hard to build an elaborate plan; the world view of the story, time base, and how to invite the audience to participate in the experience. In this study, we propose the method of visualizing a structure of the entire story with a possible tree-structure model assumed from content elements that users are thinking about when they start to work on a TMS project.

Various methods are examined, and those that yield precise answers and justifications while fostering creativity and imagination to enhance creative writing are identified. Techniques such as definition, elenchus, dialectic, maieutics, generalization, and counterfactual reasoning are discussed for their application in engineering prompt templates and their connections to inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning. Through examples, the effectiveness of these dialogue and reasoning methods is demonstrated. An interesting observation is made that when the task's goal and user intent are conveyed to GPT-3 via ChatGPT before the start of a dialogue, the large language model seems to connect to the external context expressed in the intent and perform more effectively.

AB  - Simulating real-world experiences in a safe environment has made virtual human medical simulations a common use case for research and interpersonal communication training. Despite the benefits virtual human medical simulations provide, previous work suggests that users struggle to notice when virtual humans make potentially life-threatening verbal communication mistakes inside virtual human medical simulations. In this work, we performed a 2x2 mixed design user study that had learners (n = 80) attempt to identify verbal communication mistakes made by a virtual human acting as a nurse in a virtual desktop environment. A virtual desktop environment was used instead of a head-mounted virtual reality environment due to Covid-19 limitations. The virtual desktop environment experience allowed us to explore how frequently learners identify verbal communication mistakes in virtual human medical simulations and how perceptions of credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness in the virtual human affect learner error recognition rates. We found that learners struggle to identify infrequent virtual human verbal communication mistakes. Additionally, learners with lower initial trustworthiness ratings are more likely to overlook potentially life-threatening mistakes, and virtual human mistakes temporarily lower learner credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness ratings of virtual humans. From these findings, we provide insights on improving virtual human medical simulation design. Developers can use these insights to design virtual simulations for error identification training using virtual humans.

AB  - In programming education, the instructor tries to find out the learners who needs help by grasping the learners’ development of understanding using tests that require knowledge. However, in reality, not many learners will acquire the skill of writing source codes. This kind of current situation implies that programming ability of learners cannot be measured by tests that require knowledge. This paper focuses on not only the knowledge items required for programming but also the programming thinking (computational thinking), which is the ability to combine the constituent elements of the program. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the learner’s understanding from the learner’s process to solve the code puzzles that require programming thinking as well as knowledge. We developed the interface to realize the proposed method. The experimental result with the interface showed that the proposed method could estimate with the accuracy of 80% or more.

Educational games have always helped students by promoting participation and active learning. It has helped them by motivating and bringing out the best ideas in them in order to understand a skill or a concept. It is an emerging pedagogy. This study discusses how games can help classroom teaching. Also, how the concepts that are taught through games can be used to solve real world problems. Agile software development has been taught to graduate students in the Software Engineering program using games. The games used in this study are the ones which are also used in the software industry to teach employees about Agile framework.

AB  - Humanoid robots, with a focus on personalised social behaviours, are increasingly being deployed in educational settings to support learning. However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities.

AB  - This paper describes a new technological evolution of the Sucre project, which aims to foster a vocation for science and develop computational thinking and programming skills in pre-university students. This improved version is called Sucre4Stem and has been designed from the Internet of Things perspective. At a technological level, we differentiate two main tools, SucreCore andSucreCode. SucreCore provides a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage of the different types of communications between SucreCore and the server-side platform using shared online variables and functions.

AB  - Scratch enables children to learn about programming by creating games and animations, and is currently one of the most popular introductory programming languages. While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience in teaching an introductory programming course in Python by using a visual programming development environment based on flow-charts and active learning with an interactive eBook. The field of computer science education is always being challenged with the high attrition rates despite the ever growing industry demand for computing expertise. The lower rate of student retention is often associated with considerable dropout and failure rates in introductory programming courses during the freshmen year. The main challenge is getting students to write meaningful programs in a short time by focusing more on computational thinking principles and less on language details at that point in time. Nowadays, most students prefer to be engaged and discover course content through exploration, interaction, and collaboration that is relevant, useful, and fun compared to traditional blackboard-based lecturing styles. For evaluation of learning outcomes based on the quantifiable criteria with robust statistical analysis, eleven sections of the course over three semesters were considered. The initial evaluation of summative assessment and analysis of a survey result enable us to conclude that the proposed instructional approach increases student engagement, facilitate learning and contribute to the progress of students in this course.

AB  - This article presents a course that relates environmental education and the development of STEAM skills through the valorization of WEEE (Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment). As a didactic tool, the BEAM Robots are used, which are simple robots that can be built with elements extracted from WEEE. For the execution of the course, a four-phase curriculum design is developed: propaedeutics, assembly, Computational Thinking (CT), and WEEE. The course is built in a modular way and implemented virtually. The students were evaluated with pre and post-surveys, to investigate the impact of the course. In addition, evaluation activities were created that made it possible to follow the development of the students. In general, it can be concluded that the course had a positive impact on students' STEAM skills and knowledge, as well as an improvement in environmental awareness related to the creative reuse of WEEE.

AB  - There has been a limited number of studies in which a computing curriculum is designed and developed for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but no study has tested the effectiveness of an accessible computing curriculum for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct. When the correlations between CTCs and sessions for individual groups (PDMS & RCA) were analyzed, both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in increasing scores of synchronization and all CTCs as a single construct. The accessible and the original CT curriculums were also statistically significantly effective in improving students' learning of data representation and abstraction, respectively.

AB  - As one of the most popular visual programming languages, Scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions.

AB  - Digital technology, tools, and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been an emerging trend in the design industry for the past two decades. AI is one of the latest computational technology that can mimic human intelligence and is dominating the IT industry at present. A lot of intelligent minds have connected to creating and building more smart and efficient ways of working and distributing creativeness along with the designers and their clients. They are generating the benefits such as design iterations, application of materials and their visualization, optimization of consumed time on projects, and management of information and resources. The area wherein the consumer benefits are within the product or material availabilities, and the reality of their visual perception and personalization within any space. It creates ample ideas based on personal needs and functions. This process consumes less time and makes way for better precision in the construction process with the compatibility of the tools and applications with the production mechanisms. The project working happening beyond 2 dimensions & 3 dimensions with 5D & 6D as in BIM working on multi-dimensional function with real-time extraction of information demonstrating changes in appearance, cost, and work scheduling. Being such a complex phenomenon, these need to be continuously studied as per contextual demands. This study is an assessment and analysis of the utility of these applications in built spaces by different stakeholders and changes in the design-build delivery process. These can benefit and profit designers in ways that can make their work efficient and expand their prolific enhancements in interiors that everyone can use for future studies in the longer run.

AB  - Arguably the grand goal of artificial intelligence research is to produce machines with general intelligence: the capacity to solve multiple problems, not just one. Artificial intelligence (AI) has investigated the general intelligence capacity of machines within the domain of games more than any other domain given the ideal properties of games for that purpose: controlled yet interesting and computationally hard problems. This line of research, however, has so far focused solely on one specific way of which intelligence can be applied to games: playing them. In this paper, we build on the general game-playing paradigm and expand it to cater for all core AI tasks within a game design process. That includes general player experience and behavior modeling, general non-player character behavior, general AI-assisted tools, general level generation and complete game generation. The new scope for general general game AI beyond game-playing broadens the applicability and capacity of AI algorithms and our understanding of intelligence as tested in a creative domain that interweaves problem solving, art, and engineering.

AB  - This paper presents a structural organization of declarative memories using a new model of spiking neurons. Using this model we propose a self-organizing mechanism to build episodic and semantic memories on the cognitive level. Neurons in this approach represent symbolic concepts that are stored and associated with each other based on the observed events in the environment. We demonstrate that the associative neuron and their synaptic connections yield memories that are capable to recognize sequences of events and therefore can be a foundation for episodic memories. We also demonstrate that semantic memories build using these neuron models are capable to store the knowledge and respond in a novel, creative way to input stimuli. The paper presents the developed associative neuron model, neural network organization that results from input sequences, and simulation results.

AB  - Creative problems are ill-defined, and thus experimentation, evaluation, and iteration are key elements of creative problem solving. We present a computational theory of evaluation in creative design. Our technique evaluates a design concept by analogically comparing it with alternative articulations of the concept. We operationalize this theory of analogical comparison in the context of biologically inspired design that uses biological analogies for conceptual design of technological systems. Our technique of analogical comparison supports evaluation of prior technological designs, biological source cases, as well as candidate conceptual designs through analogical mapping between alternative functional models of these design concepts. Given a functional model of a design concept and an alternative functional model of the same design concept, analogical comparison leverages a novel hierarchically organized analogical mapping technique to align the two models and identify the differences between them. Our technique is implemented in an operational artificial intelligence agent called Design Evaluation through Simulation and Comparison (DESC). We evaluate DESC through computational experimentation across several models to illustrate its strengths and limits and to highlight areas for future research.

AB  - Problems are often categorized into two types: ill-structured and well-structured, in the context of education/learning, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Then, from an educational viewpoint, ill-structured problems are further more important because they are useful to promote a learner to think about learning target deeply and to master computational or logical thinking skills, including metacognition. This paper proposes an additional characterization of problems by using two factors, (1) well/ill-structured domain model and (2) well/ill-structured problem setting. Based on this characterization, “moderately ill-structured problems” are defined as a category of problems specified by “well-structured domain model” and “ill-structured problem setting”. If a problem is set in well-structured domain model, it is possible to realize computer-based monitoring and diagnosis of learner's activities for the problem. If the problem setting is ill-structured, for example, open-ended, a learner is required to engage in the problem as ill-structured one. Therefore, moderately ill-structured problems are promising to realize computer-based intelligent support for solving ill-structured problems, while keeping educational advantages of ill-structured problems. In this paper, a definition of moderately ill-structured problems is described. Then, using the arithmetic word problems as an example of learning target domains, this paper describes (1) well-structured domain model of arithmetic word problems, and (2) design of moderately ill-structured problem as “problem-posing assignment” based on the domain model. Moreover, (3) implementation of an intelligent learning environment that requests a learner to solve ill-structured problems as problem-posing is introduced. The environment has functions to diagnose learner's behaviors and to give individual feedback.

AB  - As the classroom paradigm shifts from being teacher-centered to being learner-centered, student assessments are evolving from paper-and-pencil testing to other methods of evaluation. Students should be probed for understanding, reasoning and critical thinking abilities rather than their ability to return memorized facts. The Department of Energy's pilot program, Adventures in Supercomputing (AiS), offers one example of assessment techniques developed for learner-centered curricula. The goals and objectives that are central to student learning in the AiS program involve the acquisition of thinking and problem-solving skills. School students are involved in a year-long computational science project. To complete the project, students employ the following tools: (1) the Internet to aid in researching their topics and communicating with their mentors, (2) computers to develop and test models of the problems, and (3) visualization software to understand their data. From these resources, students must pose hypotheses, devise methods for solutions, conduct appropriate simulations and draw proper conclusions. The assessment of the AiS program has employed a variety of methods to collect student data. THe methods of assessment used were traditional testing, performance testing, interviews, questionnaires via e-mail, and student presentations of projects. The data obtained have been analyzed by a professional assessment team. The results have been used to improve the AiS curriculum and establish the quality of the overall AiS program. This paper discusses the methods of assessment used and the results.

AB  - In most of e-commerce site, evaluation systems are employed to evaluate each user after the tradings. Normally, seller's evaluation score is shown in e-commerce site that is computed based on score given by buyers. In recent e-commerce site, the evaluation is based on multiple attributes and buyers give their thinking for each attribute. In this viewpoint, the seller evaluation in e-commerce is collected knowledge from buyers and synthetic score is computational intelligence because each buyer makes his/her decision whether he/she trades with the seller. In this paper, we discuss the computational intelligence of evaluation system in e-commerce. Then, to avoid asymmetric and incomplete information in tradings, we design a mechanism of trader evaluation. After that, we give some experiments to show the rate of successful trade in our proposed mechanism. Contributions of this paper are showing theoretical discussion of e-commerce computational intelligence, design on evaluation mechanism and showing the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.

AB  - Programming has emerged as a crucial educational skill, as its acquisition correlates with the enhancement of students’ reading, writing, creative, computational, and problem-solving aptitudes. This significance is particularly pronounced in a global landscape transitioning into the 4.0 era, characterized by pervasive information technology integration into daily life. This research endeavors to explore the potential of utilizing board games for coding education, specifically targeting student demographics lacking access to modern technology and educational resources, such as ethnic groups or remote populations distanced from urban centers. The board game’s efficacy in augmenting programming comprehension was evaluated through testing and feedback solicited from students and teachers in schools across Chiang Rai Province. Moreover, insights from computer science educators were incorporated to refine gameplay and enrich knowledge components, ensuring adaptability and applicability for future educational contexts.

AB  - The increasing interest in understanding the behavior of biological neural networks, and the expanding utilization of artificial neural networks in different fields and scales, both require a thorough understanding of how technological computing works. However, von Neumann in his classic "First Draft" warned that it would be unsound to use his suggested paradigm to model neural operation, furthermore that using "too fast" processors vitiates his paradigm, which was intended only to describe (the timing relations of) vacuum tubes. Thus, it is worth scrutinizing how the present technology solutions can be used to mimic biology. Some electronic components bear a surprising resemblance to some biological structures. However, combining them using different principles can result in systems with inferior efficacy. The paper discusses how the conventional computing principles, components, and thinking about computing limit mimicking biological systems.

AB  - As part of a national strategic plan recently established by the Ministry of Education in Israel to strengthen science and technology education, an innovative Computer Science (CS) curriculum for middle school was developed. One main goal of the new curriculum is to expose students at an early stage of education to the fundamentals of CS and computational thinking, and to encourage students to study CS in the future. We present the curriculum and its initial implementation, focusing on issues of teachers' professional development.

AB  - EarSketch lowers the barriers to entry and broadens engagement in computer science through expressive and culturally relevant music composition. In EarSketch, students write computer code to remix sound samples into original music compositions, often within hours of first exposure to the application. Coupled with sound samples rooted in modern music genres, EarSketch generates deep student engagement. We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general. We conclude with suggested changes to professional development, which may be applied more generally to creative computation and STEAM-based courses.

AB  - In patient monitoring fuzzy-based evaluation can be used advantageously, because of its characteristics. This approach can work with input factors, for which sharp limits cannot be defined and it can handle uncertainties, subjectivity in the data as well as the evaluation process. The conventional Mamdani inference is the most suitable method, because it helps to build a model, which is much closer to human thinking, but its computational needs are very high, due to the complex-shape functions. This paper introduces a flexible patient monitoring system optimization, where the input functions can be tuned according to the personal statistics. Modified versions of the Mamdani inference are applied in this system, which can reduce computational complexity, while they retain the advantages of the original method.

AB  - John Clark was inventor of the Eureka machine to generate hexameter Latin verse. He labored for 13 years from 1832 to implement the device that could compose at random over 26 million different lines of well-formed verse. This article proposes that Clark should be regarded as an early cognitive scientist. Clark described his machine as an illustration of a theory of “kaleidoscopic evolution” whereby the Latin verse is “conceived in the mind of the machine” then mechanically produced and displayed. We describe the background to automated generation of verse, the design and mechanics of Eureka, its reception in London in 1845 and its place in the history of language generation by machine. The article interprets Clark's theory of kaleidoscopic evolution in terms of modern cognitive science. It suggests that Clark has not been given the recognition he deserves as a pioneer of computational creativity.

AB  - As the graphs in our world become ever larger, the need for programmable, easy to use, and highly scalable graph processing has become ever greater. One such popular graph processing model-the vertex-centric computational model-does precisely this by distributing computations across the vertices of the graph being computed over. Due to this distribution of the program to the vertices of the graph, the programmer “thinks like a vertex” when writing their graph computation, with limited to no sense of shared memory and where almost all communication between each on-vertex computation must be sent over the network. Because of this inherent communication overhead in the computational model, reducing the number of messages sent while performing a given computation is a central aspect of any efforts to optimize vertex-centric programs. While previous work has focused on reducing communication overhead by directly changing communication patterns-by altering the way the graph is partitioned and distributed, or by altering the graph topology itself-in this paper we present a different optimization strategy based on a family of complementary compile-time program transformations in order to minimize communication overhead by changing both the messaging and computational structures of programs. Particularly, we present and formalize a method by which a compiler can automatically incrementalize a vertex-centric program through a series of compile-time program transformations-by modifying the on-vertex computation and messaging between vertices so that messages between vertices represent patches to be applied to the other vertex's local state. We empirically evaluate these transformations on a set of common vertex-centric algorithms and graphs and achieve an average reduction of 2.7X in total computational time, and 2.9X in the number of messages sent across all programs in the benchmark suite. Furthermore, since these are compile-time program transformations alone, other prior optimization strategies for vertex-centric programs can work with the resulting vertex-centric program just as they would a non-incrementalized program.

AB  - The notions of concepts and emotions are mathematically described, and an "elementary" perception-cognition process is discussed inherently involving both aspects of the psyche. The mathematical nature of perception and cognition turn out to be very similar. The developed mathematical technique is practically useful for engineering designs and also corresponds to our intuition about our psyche. The paper establishes relationships between the developed mathematical techniques, classical semiotic concepts of sign and symbol, and more general notions of symbol in culture and psychology. An important and psychologically loaded notion of symbol refers to psychic processes connecting conscious and unconscious representations (concepts and archetypes). I analyze the elementary thinking process and discuss which aspects of this process are available to consciousness. This leads to a suggestion that the mathematical nature of the symbol process is similar to the perception-cognition process. Thus, thinking-process and symbol-process are same: a vortex of emotions, models-archetypes, and sensory data. This vortex brings forth into consciousness the previously unconscious contents of mind, which improve our understanding of the world.

AB  - This paper describes an on-line approach for estimating non-rigid shape and camera pose from monocular video sequences. We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.

AB  - This paper investigates the emotional reasoning abilities of the GPT family of large language models. We advocate a component perspective on evaluation that decomposes models into different aspects of emotional reasoning (appraisal derivation, affect/intensity derivation, and consequent derivation). We report two studies. A correlational study examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 performed best on the first study but performed poorly on the second (though it yielded the best results following minor prompt engineering). The evaluation raises questions about how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of such models, including dealing with variability in responses. More fundamentally, these studies highlight the benefits of the componential perspective on model evaluation.

AB  - Computational thinking is considered critical for learning to code in K-12 education standards. The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.

AB  - With the growing need for STEM workers in the job market, schools tend to look for extra-curricular activities that promote this type of skills. With activities like The Inventors or Happy Code, schools encourage kids to have a mindset more open towards technology. Despite these efforts, the tools available to teach programming to primary school students are still lacking. Available solutions can be too difficult to understand, overly expensive for school budgets or may require IT infrastructure that is lacking from the majority of public schools. As a result, this paper aims to create a concept that can convey the fundamentals of programming/Logical Thinking in an accessible and fun way, without using a computer. For this purpose we use a micro-controller, Micro: Bit, and a physical, puzzle-like representation of a programming framework, called MakeCode.

This framework is implemented using Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture, and its applicability is experienced in the field of system identification by letting a society of self-interested agents, with various skills, to identify a system based on given training data. To develop a theory about how social intelligence works, two questions were asked. First, “What was changed in time that made less intelligent societies to become more intelligent?”, and second “what drives individuals to take part in social productiveness?”. The framework reported in this paper is inspired by the answers given to these question through the study of the emergence of human civilizations, and putting it beside computer and knowledge engineering concepts. The experiments with this system show how social ensemble of simple autonomous agents can solve harder problems, while demonstrating the practicality of the proposed framework and its associated API.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), usually referred to as machine intelligence, is a scientific field that gives robots the ability to think like people. AI is a term used to describe a system that simulates human intellect using computer programming. AI is advancing quickly in many multidisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology, from healthcare to the accurate preventive measures, investigation, and treatment plans of illnesses. Because of the emphasis on imaging in the diagnosis of eye illnesses, optometry and ophthalmology is at the forefront of AI in medical field and medicine. Lately, the most prevalent illnesses that cause blindness and visual impairment, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), have been subjected to deep learning-based AI screening and predictive algorithm models. Deep learning machine with algorithms are the computer models made up of several layers of simulated neurons, are largely responsible for the success of AI in medical field and medicine. These models are capable of learning how data is represented at various levels of abstraction. The trained AI system classified the various forms of DR on optical coherence tomography pictures with accuracy equivalent to that of human specialists. In this study, we focus on the core ideas of AI and how it is applied to the various forms of DR. We also go into further detail on how AI and DL are used in the future of ophthalmology.

Especially, comparison on the perspectives of granular computing in various aspects as AI, data mining and phases of software engineering are presented, including requirement specification, system analysis and design, algorithm design, structured programming, software testing. Here we have discovered the mining patterns in the sequence of events has been an area of active research in AI. However, the focus in this body of work is on discovering the rule underlying the generation of a given sequence in order to be able to predict a plausible sequence continuation(the rule to predict what number will come next, given a sequence of numbers). Here we have used the Fuzzy based linear programming problem of Granular computing model for the purpose of mathematical simulation and we have compared it with the different existing algorithms for better performance analysis.

AB  - Existing cognitive models of narrative creation provide accounts for story invention that, while useful, are too high level to be directly applied to formal systems like computational models of narrative generation. Inversely, existing automatic story generation systems that try to implement cognitive models can only rely on approximations to the general concepts these models describe. In order to provide insight to fill the gap between these two approaches, we have conducted a study in which human participants would invent and write short stories while reflecting on their thoughts out loud. The sessions and the analysis of the recordings was designed so that we could observe which specific modifications the participants apply to their story drafts, with the intention to inform the process of creating computational systems based on cognitive descriptions of the narrative creation process. After running the experiments, annotating the videos and analysing the output, we have concluded that there are a number of common modifications that humans tend to apply to a newly created draft, and that this information can be used to the development of storytelling systems.

AB  - This innovative practice full paper proposes a model for centralizing, categorizing and organizing Computational Thinking resources and knowledge. The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.

AB  - In 2008, Lotfi Zadeh concluded that to make significant progress toward achievement of human level machine intelligence a paradigm shift is needed. In previous papers we introduced the computational information conservation theory (CICT) approach to get more effective and reliable cognitive, biophysical, and biomedical engineering simulation solutions. CICT new computational information conservation awareness can open the way for a paradigm shift to recover lost coherence information in system description and to develop even advanced quantum cognitive systems. To achieve this result, in present paper, we show the fundamental pre-spatial geometro-arithmetic scheme defining optimized numeric word generators and relations to minimize the traditional multiscale statistic modeling veil opacity and information entropy generation. It is the first, fundamental step to an effective progression from computing with numbers to computing with numeric words with precisation of their meaning. This paper is a relevant contribution towards an effective and convenient “Science 2.0” universal computational framework to achieve deeper cognitive intelligence at your fingertips and beyond.

AB  - Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.

AB  - As an important course in computer education in higher education, the programming basic course has problems in teaching and learning. The role of teachers is knowledge imparters. And the teaching methods despise students' development. Students often have fears and difficulties in their study, which is not conducive to build their computer application ability and computational thinking. In view of the teaching status quo and existing problems of the programming basic course, this paper proposes to use SPOC blended teaching mode to clarify the role of teachers and students, to develop an interactive teaching mode, to adopt case teaching, to enrich SPOC resources. And we provide students with timely feedback, and change the evaluation methods and other aspects. Through these reforms, we found that students' ability to read and write programs have been improved. The quality of teaching, and the cultivation of computational thinking are improved.

AB  - This study focused on a bachelor- university-level course that aims to design and implement a robotic-coding camp to train pre-service teachers. Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding. The most challenging part was the third step, in which participant had difficulty finding a pattern within the problem.

AB  - Computational thinking and coding has received considerable attention over the past several years. Considerable efforts worldwide suggest the need for more empirical studies providing evidence-based practices to introduce and engage children with coding activities. The main goal of this study is to examine which programming concepts students use when they want to develop a game, and what is the interrelation among these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from coding activities. In detail, during a two-week period, one-day workshops were organized almost every day on which 44 children participating in, with ages between 8-17. The workshops follow a constructionist approach and comprise of two parts. First the children interact with robots, and then develop a game using Scratch. The findings provide a deeper understanding on how children code by showing the use of specific programming concepts to develop their projects and their correlations. Hence, we improve our knowledge about children's competences in coding.

AB  - Memory and storage are important elements in consumer electronic devices. They retain data for immediate and delayed processing, and they store the results of processing for later retrieval. All consumer devices use some type of volatile and nonvolatile memory along with processing and communication. Memory and processing have been separate operations using distinct devices; however, there are products becoming available that combine processing power in storage devices, and there is work underway to create processing in close association with digital storage (often called computational storage) or even using technologies where processing is in very close association with nonvolatile memories (in-memory computing). Some emerging memory technologies even have characteristics that can mimic the operations of neurons in the brain and are being used for neuromorphic computing. Let's take a look at developments that bring processing and memory/storage together in new ways to enable smarter consumer devices.

AB  - According to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics the job outlook for computer scientists and engineers is stellar for the long term-President Obama and industry leaders encouraged colleges to graduate 10,000 more engineers a year. Computer science and engineering salaries are high, but yet it is unlikely that the number of technology majors will meet the projected demand. Sadly, for many students their first college computer science or engineering course is their last. This is particularly true for women and other under-represented groups. Over the last 20 years, we have tried to increase enrollment and retention by embedding embedded systems throughout our computer science curriculum. This year, we have extended that effort to a general education course that satisfies our campus' art and diversity requirements. Creative Fabrication demonstrates the creativity inherent in computer science and engineering through the implementation of three art projects: 1) an LED enabled sculpture representing disability, 2) a moving sculpture representing disability, and 3) a sculptural assistive technology solution designed for a specific disability. All projects connect technology to differently abled human beings via computational crafting - fabricating aesthetically pleasing and functional works.

AB  - Contrast with the increasing social demands for senior application-oriented talents, the corresponding training and education are far left behind. Drawing on the experiences in cooperation with our German counterparts, and in close combination of teaching activities in the mode of open-ended project-based learning, we propose to apply the open-ended project-based learning mode into experiments of information and computational sciences. Its contents, characteristics, as well as practical achievements are clearly elaborated. We focus our research and analysis on the resources of experiment projects, organization, environment, and effectiveness of the open-ended experiment-project-based learning mode. It is revealed that the unique characteristics of this learning mode is its open nature, which enables the students to freely and actively select the supervisors, partners, learning environment, as well as high-quality projects.

AB  - Playing video games on personal computers is known as PC gaming. PC games are available in a variety of genres, offer both single-player and multiplayer options, and have spawned an international e-sports industry. Modding communities are active, digital distribution systems are essential, and hardware can be customized. Future developments in gaming, such as virtual reality, cloud gaming, and artificial intelligence, portend more innovation in the industry. The game, Plants vs Zombies is represented by Finite Automata and it is ruled by DFAs and NFAs which describe the actions and behaviours of both the plants and the zombies and the result of their actions. In the proposed work you can notice how the NFA will be converted to DFA and vice versa due to its handy functions. Overall, "Plants vs Zombies" is a fun and interactive way for players to explore computational thinking while learning about the complex ideas of NFA and DFA in Automata Theory. The advantages are Synchronize State Management, Consistent State Transitions, Easier Development, and Unambiguous Animation Staging.

AB  - The last 30 years have witnessed a qualitative change in our conception of how people learn (usually called the "cognitive revolution"), so that we think today not only in terms of acquiring discrete facts and skills but also in far more powerful terms of acquiring new ways of thinking. Of particular importance is the process of acquiring the habits of systematic and disciplined inquiry characteristic of organized science. To the social theorist and policy maker, however, the existence of a new, more powerful view of learning is a mixed blessing. Decisions of how best to implement the lessons of the cognitive revolution require technocratic know-how as well as social and political judgment. I discuss the cognitive revolution by offering a comparison of two contrasting views of education that it has produced, which I call "institution-centred" and "person-centred" methodologies. In terms of their pedagogical effectiveness, both methodologies have been shown to be successful, when implemented in a congenial social environment by competent professionals. The essential difference is political. An institution-centered methodology has as side-effect to encourage a greater sense of commitment, loyalty and perhaps even dependence in regard to teachers, educational and social institutions and authority figures in general; in contrast, a person-centered methodology encourages a greater sense of autonomy and self-reliance. Cognitive methods can be useful for policy makers with a wide range of priorities and commitments, if correctly chosen.

AB  - Problem solving tests associated with convergent thinking are often used to analyze the creative ability of an individual. Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like.

The courses were developed to address industry's need for improved problem-solving skills, incorporating consistent, deep collaboration with Google technical staff The first of its kind for CAHSI, the problem-solving courses are fewer credit hours than typical courses in order to fit within a traditional curriculum. The intent is to instill complementary problem-solving, computational thinking skills, and logical reasoning needed to succeed in computer science, and make this content available across different student populations at various stages in their academic pathways. Advanced problem solving prepares students for competitive interviews. The courses create opportunities to learn across academic levels, and create new student communities, mentorship opportunities, and social connections to support retention. The paper reports on the course design, student reflection, assessment and evaluation, and an ethnographic study of the courses.

Influenced by the social constructivist paradigm, modern teaching promotes collaborative learning and peer assessment as two effective active learning strategies to which technologies are becoming increasingly important assistance. This paper presents three cases in which various technologies were deployed in some undergraduate biology courses to maximize students' active learning opportunities.

AB  - As metaphorical representations showed beneficial effects on several parts of computer science, this paper focuses on the question: How can metaphorical representations in VR enhance the understanding of theoretical computer science concepts? A concept for an immersive educational virtual environment for learning the theoretical computer science concept of finite state machines is presented. A first draft for the virtual reality aims to immerse students in a world of islands (states) with treasure islands (final states). Each symbol from the input alphabet is illustrated through another boat on every island. Students navigate through the islands by looking at one of the boats on the current island using a head-mounted-display. They then take the shipping route of the selected boat (the state-transition function) by pressing a button on a controller. The goal of the game can either be to reach Treasure Island and open the treasure chest or to complete the map.

AB  - This study designs a jigsaw collaborative learning method in a metaverse virtual space (JCLM-MVS) to promote learning performance and CT in Scratch programming. This study used a quasi-experimental research method with 48 fifth-grade students from two classes in Taiwan's elementary school as the research participants. One class of 24 students was randomly assigned to the experimental group using JCLM-MVS to conduct Scratch programming learning, whereas the other class of 24 students was assigned to the control group using the traditional teacher-centered teaching method. The study found that the experimental group of learners showed significantly better learning performance than the control group. Although the results showed no statistically significant difference in overall and most dimensions of CT between the two groups, both learning approaches were found to promote CT effectively.

AB  - Knowledge based methodology is one of the primary areas of development in engineering problem solving methods for decades. In the meantime, product definition has been moved into model space. Establishment of the STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, ISO 10303) product model standard and it application at leading industries during 90's facilitated development of model based integrated solutions for product engineering. During the past decade, the new paradigm of product lifecycle management stimulated integrated handling of information for lifecycle of products. Product model has become a medium in communication between end users of engineering systems including humans and controlled equipment. One of the most critical elements in this scenario is communication of knowledge with product modeling processes in order to generate knowledge background of engineering object definition in product model. This paper introduces a method by the authors to extract knowledge background during definition of product objects in the form of initiated affect on product. Human thinking process is modeled by its elements during definition of intent for a change of a product. Evolving steps towards the defined object changes and the served objectives for the defined objects are recorded. Following this, process for the definition of coordinated product behaviors and affect propagation in a specific and purposeful change affect zone are explained. Finally, an extended product definition space is explained as medium in integrated product modeling using the proposed method.

AB  - At present, the lack of emotion is very serious in E-Learning. The most learning platforms can't imitate teaching behavior of the real teacher, and can't provide the emotional communication between teachers and students, so students are easy to lose learning interest. In 3D virtual learning environment based on virtual reality, a 3D virtual teacher can imitate the figure, action, facial expression and teaching behavior of the real teacher, which enrich emotional experience, arouse learning interest and promote creative thinking of students. The modeling technology of 3D virtual teacher is discussed in this paper.

AB  - A description is given of a systolic Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm for Boolean n-cubes with a substantial amount of storage per cube node. In mapping a Cooley-Tukey type FFT to such a network, the main concerns are effective use of the high connectivity/bandwidth of the Boolean n-cube, the computational resources, the storage bandwidth, if there is a storage hierarchy, and the pipelines should the arithmetic units have such a feature. Another important consideration in a multiprocessor, distributed storage architecture is the allocation and access to coefficients, if they are precomputed. FFT algorithms are described that use both the storage bandwidth and the communication system optimally and require storage of P+nN coefficients for a transform on P>or=N data elements. A complex-to-complex FFT on 16 million points is predicted to require about 1.5 s on a Connection Machine model CM-2.<>

However, it is not just a task structure, a documentation requirement, or a defined and formalized manifestation of processes, but the integration of a new way of thinking and approach into everyday work. When implementing Scrum, different Agile elements may be cumbersome for different professional levels and job positions for different reasons. The cumbersomeness and the causes are investigated in our primary research.

AB  - Many of us write code regularly as part of our scientific activity, perhaps even as a full-time job. But even though we write--and use--more and more code, we rarely think about the roles that this code will have in our research, in our publications, and ultimately in the scientific record. In this article, the author outlines some frequent roles of code in computational science. These roles aren't exclusive; in fact, it's common for a piece of code to have several roles, at the same time or as an evolution over time. Thinking about these roles, ideally before starting to write the code, is a good habit to develop.

In this paper, an approach is proposed for building cognitive systems which can solve human creativity tests. The importance of using cognitively viable processes, cognitive knowledge acquisition and organization, and cognitively comparable evaluation when implementing creative problem-solving systems is emphasized. Two case studies of artificial cognitive systems evaluated with human creativity tests are reviewed. A general approach is put forward. The applicability of this general approach to other creativity tests and artificial cognitive systems, together with ways of performing cognitive knowledge acquisition for these systems are then explored.

AB  - This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents an approach to improve teaching materials and assessment tools for K-12 programming education together by creating a virtuous cycle. Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together.

AB  - Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural "somatic logic" found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks

AB  - With the introduction of distance learning during the lockdown, teachers faced a number of problems on how to implement the teaching. Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity – a project – using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students’ work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes.

The Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF) cultivates interest in engaging in models from an multidisciplinary perspective and enables junior scientists to see how computational modeling is a creative and collaborative process. In the following, I describe ways, based in part on my own experiences as a CSGF recipient, in which modeling can be used both to understand the molecular world and to excite others about computational science.

AB  - The introduction of Computational Thinking skills at school has mostly been associated with programming skills. In this paper we present an approach that is based on modeling, a skill that is commonly taught in Computer Science degrees, often in the last years as it is considered a higher-level, complex skill. Modeling includes various thinking processes like abstraction, reduction, structuring, generalization, among others, that are part of computational thinking in particular and problem solving in general, too. Our hypothesis is that using different modeling techniques from computer science (e.g., UML diagrams) in several subjects at school can be a good way to introduce computational thinking. Therefore we have performed a semi-controlled experiment with Ni=558 students (age 8-16) and N2=18 educators that have used modeling in their lessons. Our results show a promising effect of the use of modeling in the lessons. Educators have a positive vision of modeling.

AB  - For many people, writing is a difficult task because finding a good topic and suitable elements is just not an easy job. In this study, we put our focus on narrative creation and propose that a Picture-Attributed-Note (PAN) framework can help with writing job. Picture and attributed notes were used to present and record story elements and to stimulate creativity. The attributed notes are presented in texts and characterized through the following six attributes: Character, Location, Object, Situation, Action, and Theme (CLOSAT) were used in this study to categorize the texts. We hope that stimulated through the pictures and attributed notes, users can better utilize creativity for their stories. In this study, we have implemented the PAN framework as a computer-aided system and conducted experiments to find out how one user would utilize the PAN system for story writing. Four participants were invited to create a story, including one without using the PAN system. We used content analysis to analyze the data through four main categories of coding: Conceptual, Operational, Perceptional and Evaluation (COPE), proposed by Chen [1]. The results reveal that the PAN system helps stimulate user's creativity and did not change their main creating process. In addition, the user interface of the PAN system could allow the user to concentrate more on the writing creation process.

AB  - This paper presents a study on fusing creative operations into evolutionary computation for music composition, as an attempt to provide a collaborative creation environment between human and machine and to investigate into the mind process during music creation. A framework based on the paradigm of evolutionary computation is proposed to incorporate key mechanisms observed in the creation process and implemented to work on evolving abstract musical ideas and thoughts. The developed software framework is released as open source. The collaborative creation process, involving the framework, the composer, and the performer, is presented and discussed, and the results of this study also include a composed music work for unaccompanied cello, played by a renowned cellist.

AB  - The fast pace of change in high technology product development requires high flexibility and adaptation in product design and technology management. Within this context, appropriate learning environments are planned to shape future Information and Communication Technology staff in such a way they could get able to keep up with new trends and innovations. A constructivist educational model based on Active Learning represents a step towards this vision for staff training. This paper deals with a new organization of a 13 weeks course based on the inverted class model, where students are introduced to the problem-posing domain by a direct involvement of enterprises, which participate specifically to the problem definition and assessment phases. In the case study shown, students simulate a production business unit in all the phases that characterize the product/service development life cycle. A mixed traditional and company-based organization of the course is supposed to improve students competences by proposing solutions leveraging on appropriate tools taken from traditional experiences and also gaining benefits from a learning-by-doing approach that encourages the use of state-of-the-art solutions. A preliminary study is performed to see how expected professional competences are met during the course, with the additional goal of collecting indications that could help to improve the learning framework for future editions of the course.

However, the questions “What is Mathematics?” and “What is Physics?” remain unanswered, and it is not surprising that the specification of computation likewise remains unresolved, in spite of the increasing centrality of the computing discipline.

AB  - The widespread usage of wearables set the foundations for many new applications that process the wearable sensor data. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a well-studied application that targets to classify the data captured by multiple wearable sensors into one of a predefined set of activity classes. Earlier approaches in the area relied on Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, while many researchers proposed solutions based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), e.g., using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Convolution Neural Network (CNNs). Even though the usage of DNNs for HAR is a widely explored field, the problem of compressing (thus reducing the computational requirements) the resulting DNN models has been disregarded by the research community. This is of paramount importance if we consider that wearables are characterized by scarce memory and computational resources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of the size of the various CNN components (focusing on the convolution and dense layers) to the model validation performance. As a second step, we focus on two CNN models with diverse memory characteristics (the lean and the fat model) and we employ three different compression techniques (Filter-Based Pruning –FBP,– Low Rank Factorization –LRF,– and dynamic range quantization) assuming various compressibility scenarios.

This paper explains what is human intelligence; why AI can't make machine humanlike intelligence; then introduces Ubit intelligence by experiment examples; make machine memorize knowledge from learning, understand the memorized knowledge in machine, think the memorized knowledge in machine like human without AI algorithm, and explains how it can make machine humanlike intelligence. This paper also introduces the foundation of Ubit Intelligence: Ubit Semantic Computing, a total new theory. The advantages of Ubit intelligence listed show that Ubit intelligence is far beyond artificial intelligence.

AB  - The ongoing liberalisation of the power sector adds a new dimension to the main issues in modelling of power systems. The very complex interactions and interdependencies among power market participants are much like those studied in game theory. However, the strategies used by market participants are often too complex to be conveniently modelled by standard game theoretic techniques. In addition, there has been much less research in the field of dynamic strategic behaviour and their impact on the electricity price in European markets. In this paper, we show new, prosperous combination of computational science and new ideas in evolutionary economics and cognitive science offering appealing extensions to traditional game theoretical modelling. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing our approach in Matlab using learning algorithm and illustrate its advantages in more detailed and realistic representation of the strategic behaviour of biggest power producers in European power market.

What are colloquially known as programming games present these challenges as puzzles where computational thinking and coding skills have a fundamental role in successfully overcoming them, even though they are not serious games and have been designed purely as entertainment products. Indeed, algorithm design and coding is the fun part. This paper presents a survey of all such games up to February 2020 published in the Steam digital distribution platform, categorizing them by content covered according to a basic programming curriculum. This study provides some insights on the nature of this kind of games and allows assessing their adequacy as educational tools, broadening the body of knowledge on available games for teaching computational thinking and coding, beyond serious games.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence for the 21st century. It refers to a set of capacities and skills that can be stimulated to facilitate the teaching-learning process in a wide range of fields, including Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Experts in information technology argue that the earlier children are exposed to programming through digital platforms appropriate for their age, the easier it will be for them to assimilate their concepts in the future. This effort should be continued throughout the educational stages of children and youth to increase students' interest in pursuing STEM studies and careers.This paper describes the Scratch4All project promoted by the consortium CASPAE (a Private Social Solidarity Institution) and Inova-Ria, with technical assistance from professors at the public higher education institution Coimbra Institute of Engineering. Scratch4All Project includes the activities Scratch on Road, Programming and Robotics Lab, and the Scratch4All Digital Platform. According to the impact assessment for the school year 2020-2021, the Scratch4All project promotes school success and true equality in access to new technologies for students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary school, developing essential skills for their academic and professional future such as computational thinking, STEM competencies and social skills. By encouraging young girls to participate in technological projects, this project also aims to combat gender stereotypes.

The lessons were intended to support students' computational thinking while learning mathematics. To do so, we used the educational design research (EDR) methodology to develop the lessons. We collaborated with mathematics teachers and practitioners to improve the lessons. We also piloted the lessons for a few junior high school students in Indonesia. We collected data from online discussions with teachers and practitioners, GeoGebra files, and screen video recordings. We found that collaboration with teachers and practitioners helped us to refine the lessons. The pilot study showed the engagement of students in programming and debugging. Mostly students could solve the final task to create an inscribed polygon in a circle.

AB  - Now with the current state of power engineering, the idea of a microgrid (MG) is widely accepted because of how quickly energy electronics are being made. People are also becoming more interested in direct current (DC) MGs because DC delivery schemes have benefits like less damage and quick alignment of energy loading resources. With the rise of distributed output, a DCMG with many fonts is an important area to investigate. In this DCMG with many sources, the goal is to offer voltage help and strong value division. The control technique includes a thorough analysis of the "state-of-the-art" control procedures in DCMGs. This is important because it makes sure that MG's power and performance are always the same. In this section, the main and secondary control mechanisms in the DCMG hierarchy are explained. In particular, the main ways to control internal loop and droop control are looked at. The secondary regulation is a solution that is centralized, spread out, and independent.

AB  - To better understand the nature, function and elicitation conditions of emotion it is important to approach studying emotion from a multidisciplinary perspective involving psychology, neuroscience and affective computing. Recently, the TDRL Theory of Emotion has been proposed. It defines emotions as variations of temporal difference assessments in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present new evidence for this theory. We show that regret - a negative emotion that signifies that an alternative action should have been taken given new outcome evidence - is modelled by a particular form of TD error assessment. In our model regret is attributed to each action in the state-action trace of an agent for which - after new reward evidence - an alternative action becomes the best action in that state (the new argmax) after adjusting the action value of the chosen action in that state. Regret intensity is modeled as the difference between this new best action and the adjusted old best action, reflecting the additional amount of return that could have been received should that alternative have been chose. We show in simulation experiments how regret varies depending on the amount of adjustment as well as the adjustment mechanism, i.e. Q-trace, Sarsa-trace, and Monte Carlo (MC) re-evaluation of action values. Our work shows plausible regret attribution to actions, when this model of regret is coupled with MC action value update. This is important evidence that regret can be seen as a particular variation of TD error assessment involving counterfactual thinking.

AB  - This paper examines fundamental problems underlying difficulties encountered by pattern recognition algorithms, neural networks, and rule systems. These problems are manifested as combinatorial complexity of algorithms, of their computational or training requirements. The paper relates particular types of complexity problems to the roles of a priori knowledge and adaptive learning. Paradigms based on adaptive learning lead to the complexity of training procedures, while nonadaptive rule-based paradigms lead to complexity of rule systems. Model-based approaches to combining adaptivity with a priori knowledge lead to computational complexity. Arguments are presented for the Aristotelian logic being culpable for the difficulty of combining adaptivity and a priority. The potential role of the fuzzy logic in overcoming current difficulties is discussed. Current mathematical difficulties are related to philosophical debates of the past.

AB  - Weiser inspired us by forcing us to think differently about the size and usage patterns of computers. This vision of computational materials is similarly motivated. Indeed, inspiration is critical at this time, because there are so many challenges to overcome and it will take a community to address them. Significant technical challenges and a desire to deliver meaningful value while guarding against violations of greater societal values can only happen if we are fueled by the passion of this vision.

AB  - When large data repositories are coupled with geographic distribution of data, users and systems, it is necessary to combine different technologies for implementing high-performance distributed knowledge discovery systems. On the other hand, computational grid is emerging as a very promising infrastructure for high-performance distributed computing. Grid applications such as astronomy, chemistry, engineering, climate studies, geology, oceanography, ecology, physics, biology, health sciences and computer science often involve large amounts of computing and/or data. For these reasons, we think grids can offer an effective support to the implementation and use of parallel and distributed data mining systems. This paper describes development of parallel and distributed prior algorithm on grid environment. Apriori algorithm along with FP-growth (frequent pattern growth) is implemented on grid network in each grid node, which finds the local support counts and prunes all infrequent item sets. After completing local pruning, each grid node broadcasts messages containing all the remaining frequent patterns to the coordinator. We have compared the output of conventional method of apriori algorithm with FP-tree in both homogenous and heterogeneous environments. Practical datasets are large in nature and taken from the UCI machine repository and are related to adult, mushroom, and letter recognition, are used to measure the system performance. The detailed experiment procedure and result analysis are also discussed in this paper. In future the security issue among different local datasets and the huge communication cost in data migration can be considered.

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math-ematics) education is crucial, rising the demand for technological skills driven by the Industry 4.0 digital transformation, and fostering problem-solving, autonomy, computational thinking, creativity, innovation, and effective teamwork skills. To properly address the lack of structured materials in secondary schools, an Educational Design Research (EDR) project was developed to introduce young students to STEM, and particularly to electronics field. For this purpose, the developed approach combines instructionism and constructionism methods, through three educational projects and “Drops of knowledge” modules. The developed material was applied to 9th and 12th grades of a secondary school, with the achieved results showing that this immersive approach effectively provides students with the necessary competencies to tackle the initial technological challenges of electronics. The project was recognized by the Directorate General of Education of Portugal as a recommended practice of a digital initiative within secondary schools.

AB  - This Research Work in Progress Paper aims to develop holistic competencies in engineering students through course-level teaching and learning activities. Information is the core of many engineering fields, such as communications engineering, signal processing, and computational intelligence. Despite its ambient existence in our everyday lives, most of the engineering students are not aware of the connection between information and their professional role as an engineer in the informational world. We seek to engage engineering students in understanding their professional and ethical responsibility, and promote their awareness of the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context. Our study is grounded in the intersection between two theoretical frameworks: (1) Holistic Competencies and (2) William Perry’s scheme of intellectual and ethical development. Having students’ learning evidence against William Perry’s framework and identified students’ cognitive changes along their course study, we suggest that holistic competencies can be fostered through cultivating students’ multifaceted understanding of information and supplementing with real cases where social media serve as a channel for students to exchange ideas to address various global challenges.

AB  - Technological trends have evolved, extended and converged in the 21st century. Much of these evolutions are incremental, differential and the aim is to sustain or rise above others amidst a dynamic landscape. As data and knowledge bases extend, the fitness of features in each evolution requires systemic modelling targeting multi-objectives. Identification of the local regions of interest and significant features enable more efficient optimization. The information core, current or new invariant features which proceed to the next iteration coupled with gamification in certain domains, can lead to varying implications. This paper briefly reviews literature on associative networks, case-based reasoning, combinations and permutations, optimization, and gamification and conclude with implications and opportunities for symbiotic networks.

AB  - Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a popular machine learning tool that is gaining increasing attention as a useful feature selector and classifier. In an effort to understand its strengths and weaknesses, we performed a series of experiments with synthetic data and compared its performance to its close relative from which it was initially invented, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input.Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data. Other methods were also evaluated.Our work sheds light on the kind of relationships and data models with which PLS-DA can be effective both as a feature selector as well as a classifier. In particular, we claim that when classes are determined by linear or non-linear relationships, PLS-DA provides almost no insight into the data. But it is effective when the classes have a clustered distribution on the signal features, even when these features are hidden among a large number of noise. PLS-DA retains a strong performance even when the classes are contained in n-orthotopes (i.e., rectangular boxes in the subspace of the signal features).Finally, we analyzed an interesting data set from 396 vaginal microbiome samples where the ground truth for the feature selection was available. Again, the results highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of PLS-DA in comparison with PCA.

AB  - Cognitive training is considered as an effective intervention for slowing cognitive decline, however single-domain training programs have shown limited transfer to untrained tasks. Complex cognitive training has a potential to yield broader transfer effect. Given that creative thinking involves variety of cognitive subprocesses, creative tasks may be useful as a complex training paradigm. In line with this assumption, creative engagement has a neuroprotective effect in older subjects, improving mental health and well-being. However, neural mechanisms underlying the effect has remained unknown. Evidence suggests that post-task changes in resting-state brain activity may be detected in regions involved during training. The current study was aimed to reveal changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during creative task performance and to identify whether those activity patterns persist in the baseline EEG after the end of a creative session. EEG was registered in 25 elderly ( 64±6 years) high-functioning subjects before, during and after creative problem solving, consisting of 30 verbal and 30 figural tasks. Current source density estimates and subsequent statistical contracts using statistical non-parametrical mapping (SnPM) were calculated via LORETA package. We found a significant increase of spectral density from pre- to post-task interval in theta-gamma frequency bands. The effect was localized in parieto-occipital cortex, overlapping with the region showing synchronization during the tasks performance. Observed changes in resting-state EEG activity may be considered as an indicator of use-dependent neuroplasticity.

AB  - This concept paper suggests a new way of thinking about the origin, growth, and spread of a general-purpose "scientific habit of mind" in humans, and discusses how intelligent coaching agents may help. The argument begins with a description of the role of the cognitive cycle in animal thinking. We then examine critical differences between non-human and human cognition, especially in respect to the crucial and yet problematic role of language and linguistic interaction in the "widening spread and deepening hold" of scientific thinking and discourse in human populations. The paper concludes with a vision of a new kind of open, networked learning community inhabited by human learners, human experts, and intelligent agents, and suggests ways of evaluating the development of scientific thinking within these communities using a combination of social network and semantic space analysis.

AB  - This system proposes a question-answer model to analyze answers given by the users to the open-ended question. For this system, we use a squad dataset. The squad dataset is helpful for open-ended questions. The model uses NLP and the BERT question-answer model for handling the answers. Problem-solving deals with the analysis of questions and answering them in a creative, feasible, and efficient way. The problem-solving the approach gives the way of thinking of the problem solver. Computational methods along with NLP are being developed to calculate these indices. With the help of question-answer systems in NLP, the users’ answers are analyzed and measured are being attempts to perform such analysis but the answers to the questions are varied from person to person which makes answer analysis challenging. Answers given by users and answer for the question present in the squad dataset is compared by using cosine similarity to calculate the creativity index. The creativity index is a linear combination of fluency, flexibility, uniqueness, and elaboration indices; calculated for every given answer by comparing given answers and the stored answers. The system is trained and tested for the general questions present in the squad dataset. This system is beneficial to predict and measure the creative thinking, problem-solving ability, and thinking ability of the user. It helps to build the work culture, societal culture, and behavior of individuals in the institution, community, and workplace. The CI is a tremendously useful tool for businesses, office employees, and students. Thinking and problem-solving skills are calculated using this technique.

This article proposes a new computational model and the related algorithmic methods to characterize circuit design communities over time. The bottom-up model explains knowledge evolution using two operators, combination/improvement for knowledge expansion, and blocking for concept elimination. New metrics were proposed to describe the effect of the two operators. Experiments considered three large data sets of circuit designs (switched-capacitor filters, CMOS OpAmp/OTAs, and ΔΣ ADCs). Opportunities to improve the communities were discussed.

AB  - Quantum Key Distribution technology is maturing quickly. The systems that were once closer to laboratory devices and focused on the single link are nowadays commercial products, and the companies that build them are ramping up production. Now there is a need to go beyond the single link and start thinking in getting closer to the network. In this talk we will explore, from a standardization point of view, the network architectures available and the gaps that need to be closed to support the creation of large-scale quantum secure networks, like the planned European Quantum Communications Infrastructure.

AB  - The authors report on a model-based object recognition system and its parallel implementation on the Connection Machine system. The goal is to recognize two-dimensional objects in a scene, given a reasonably large database of known objects. The system uses massively parallel hypotheses generation and parameter space clustering in place of serial constraint propagation. Local boundary features that constrain an object's position and orientation provide a basis for hypothesis generation. Parameter space clustering of hypotheses is used to rank hypotheses according to preliminary evidence prior to verification. This greatly reduces the time for recognition and number of hypotheses that must be tested. Experiments show that the time required by this approach scales at a much slower range than either the number of objects in the database or objects in the scene.<>

AB  - Computer Science (CS) seems to be everywhere - in our smartphones, apps, cars, watches and so much more. It is integrated into almost every discipline and has a growing importance in our daily lives, yet even with top salaries, exciting companies, and promising careers, the job market remains underpopulated and under-representative of women. Though its applications are everywhere, CS is an often misunderstood field due to lack of exposure and knowledge. This paper explores the misperception associated with Computer Science and examines the efforts to make it more inclusive by attracting women, introducing CS earlier at the K-12 level, and improving entry-level college courses.

AB  - The paradigm of education has undergone a significant transition from traditional teacher-directed instruction to student-centered problem-based learning. In various contexts, problem-based learning, computational thinking, and metaphor-based learning approaches have been used to deliver an efficacious learning of the concept. This paper puts forward a model and its usage to build metaphor based case studies directing towards cognitive thinking, self-directed learning and lifelong learning. The model directly influences on the problem solving thought process. The paper further presents a case study on application of this model and its effectiveness validated through the embedded design method. The method appears to be effective in from model analysis and feedback collected. This directly connects to the pattern recognition paradigm of the computational thinking process.

AB  - The deleterious effects of not bringing projects quickly from the laboratory to the market are described, and corporate efforts to cut development time are examined. Many Japanese companies have already wrestled with this problem and moved on to other issues, like their need for basic research. As a result, many US corporations are looking to the Japanese for guidance. This is leading companies to restructure their organizations to encourage open, frequent, and early communication. Launching research projects with technology transfer in view from the start is another approach modeled after the Japanese. Central to Japanese technology transfer is the fact that as a project moves from laboratory to market, the engineers move with it. This is also being tried by some US firms. A less widespread approach to shortening time to market is called concurrent engineering, in which an item is designed concurrently with the processes that would be used to assemble it, manufacture its parts, test it, and repair it in the field. Standardization is also being used to boost researchers' output.<>

AB  - Currently, the power sector is characterized by the dispersion of data across different times, spaces, or complexities, as well as difficulties in the unified collection of sample data, leading to significant challenges in obtaining multi-scale fine-tuning samples. In light of this, this paper focuses on the collection and preprocessing of textual data in the power sector and proposes a method for constructing multi-scale fine-tuning samples in the power sector based on the chain of thought. By introducing multi-scale analysis methods, power system data is divided according to different temporal and spatial scales, thereby creating a sample set with hierarchical structure and diversity. This method can adaptively adjust the selection and enhancement strategies of samples based on the characteristics of data at different scales, thus effectively representing and modeling the complex data of the power system and improving the efficiency and accuracy of text data processing in the power sector.

AB  - Unlike enrollment in undergraduate computer science degree programs, there are no gender or ethnic imbalances in K-12 enrollment. While such disparities are seen at particular schools, such disparities do not exist in disciplinary courses such as history, math, or science where all students are required to take these courses. This paper discusses an approach to broaden minority participation in computing through the integration of Computer Science (CS) into a history course. This poster proposes an alignment between computational thinking and historical thinking that makes history courses an attractive fit for CS integration. It also presents results from the pilot study of a project-based cross-disciplinary curriculum using MIT App inventor that leverages students' interests in mobile technology to facilitate the creation of historical mobile apps. This curricular approach is built on a theoretical framework rooted in Constructivist and Constructionist learning where students construct and produce knowledge, artifacts, and technology rather than consume them. Our initial results suggest that students were engaged in the material and were enthusiastic about the creation of their mobile app.

AB  - Introducing middle school students to STEAM projects can foster an interest in computer science and engineering solutions. These projects provide hands-on experiences that may encourage students to explore careers in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics. Engaging students in real-world problems can help them develop critical thinking skills and generate innovative ideas. STEAM projects can also spark students' curiosity and creativity. This paper will explore developing and implementing a STEAM lesson to introduce students to the engineering and design process and computational thinking. Moreover, this project also addresses a major environmental concern currently in New Jersey, specifically the destruction of the environment by the spotted lanternfly. Therefore, students are also applying skills in civil duty and environmental awareness as a part of their design and plan to eradicate this invasive species.

AB  - Over the past decade, the teaching of coding and computational thinking has become increasingly important in the school environment. If before they were a secondary part of the teaching program and provided only, at best, from the age of eleven and up, it is now clear that they should play a relevant role in the school curriculum as soon as possible. In recent years, many solutions, both papery and software applications, have been developed for encoding. However, the remaining problem is that every available solution has been designed for a very precise and limited scope, both of age and skills, without thinking of a more generalizable use for a long period. This work therefore aims to choose some of the tools available, designed for different needs but sufficiently similar in order to allow the development of a fluid and continuous coding educational path, gradually adding new complexities, starting from the age of three in the school of childhood, up to high school.

AB  - Design rationale (DR) explains the product design decision-making process and the reason behind the decision. Capturing and reusing of the DR plays an important role in design thinking guidance and decision support. In order to clearly reflect the essential characteristics of design activities such as design iteration and design evolution in design process, a reconstruction method of the DR model is proposed based on design context. The limitations of the existing DR models in the expression of evolution information and knowledge reuse support are illustrated. And the concept of design context is put forward and two new DR element interaction relationships are defined to reconstruct FGDR model to eliminate redundant information. So the method contributes to optimize the DR model in its knowledge expression form and knowledge expression ability. This can further strengthen the DR model's support to design reuse. A prototype system is developed for DR modeling and reconstruction. Partial design process of the POGO mechanical system design is taken as an example to validate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.

AB  - Integral of single variable functions is an important issue in calculus. This problem is widely applied in many fields such as physics, economics, etc. Systems for automatic solving integral problems are necessary tools in education. They support students and teachers in learning and teaching. Current computer algebra systems such as Maple, Mathematica, etc can solve integral problems. However, they output the result only or are limited to give the complete solution. This paper presents a model for representing knowledge about single variable functions and proposes some algorithms for solving integral problem automatically. These algorithms mimic the human way of thinking and produce the solution that explains the calculus process.

AB  - In this study, digital game design is analyzed as a team-based knowledge modelling process. In the context of a graduate seminar, the students were organized in teams and were asked to design a serious game. In the early stages of the process, each team had the possibility to engage in a topic suggested by the professor or decide their topic of interest. Half of the teams choose a suggested topic (herd immunity, intergenerational communication, active ageing); the other half proposed a topic of their choice (inuits and micmacs, banker-customer relationship, French as a Foreign Language). In both cases, the students should engage in a participative design process which requires a learner-centered analysis. We analyze both the digital game design process and outcomes of the game design from the perspective of social participation and the 4C competencies deployed in the game design process: communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking.

AB  - Mobile data acquisition technology in the hands of computer-proficient college students provides opportunities to transform electronics laboratory education into a more ubiquitous model. The use of virtual instruments (VIs), handheld data acquisition (DAQ) modules, and supporting portable hardware can (a) encourage students to work outside of the classroom on procedural hands-on learning activities and (b) promote students' higher-level thinking via instructor and student interactions during follow-on meeting times. This project, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program, explores ways to implement this more ubiquitous education model. The project team will (1) develop inexpensive mobile laboratory tools, (2) create new laboratory protocols, (3) assess the impact of these learning experiences, and (4) disseminate these tools and assessment results. This paper focuses on tasks (2) and (3) for four courses in the East Carolina University (ECU) General Engineering program and the Kansas State University (KSU) Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) programs.

AB  - This paper presents a case study that explores the successful integration of project-based learning (PBL) in two courses, Biometry and Computer Vision, at the University of -DFBR-. The study emphasizes the positive impact of PBL not only on academic performance but also on student well-being, motivation, and self-regulated learning skills. In both courses, PBL was employed as a powerful tool to actively engage students in their learning process and enhance their understanding of complex subjects. The project developed by the students served as a vehicle to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, ensuring the comprehensive coverage of the course topics. The outcome of this study revealed a positive impact of PBL methodology on student performance, which was indicated by their final grades and active participation during synchronous moments throughout the course duration. Moreover, the implementation of PBL has fostered a positive and motivating learning environment, as students embrace the opportunity to work on authentic, hands-on projects. The enhancement of self-regulated learning skills, including goal setting, time management, and re-flection, further contributes to students' overall academic growth. Furthermore, the transversal skills acquired by students in the PBL environment are relevant. Collaborative problem-solving, effective communication, critical thinking, and adaptability are just a few of the key skills that students develop through their active engagement in projects. This paper offers an exploration of the successful integration of PBL in engineering education. The study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of PBL, not only in the referred courses but as a model for innovative engineering education practices. The experience at the University of -DFBR- illustrates how PBL can nurture a new generation of competent, motivated, and adaptable engineers, ready to tackle the challenges of an ever-changing world.

AB  - We present an exploratory study that aims to diagnose the Engineering in Computational Technologies students' level of awareness with respect to the impact of the accelerated use of technology and the exponential growth that private socio-digital platforms have in everyday life because of the COVID-19 confinement. We research possible deterministic postures in the students' positions that could impede their ethical analysis of the social and environmental effects of the advance of data capitalism, among which racialization, algorithmic sexualization, and discrimination, as well as the erosion of the Commons on the Internet, stand out. The theoretical approach comes from a decolonial ethical framework, and the methodology of this study is qualitative. It consists of, in the first phase of the implementation, two focus groups with engineering students between the ages of 19 and 22 from different semesters and genders. In a second phase, we include eight in-depth interviews with professors from the School of Engineering and the School of Humanities who teach disciplinary and general education subjects in two campuses of a private university in Mexico.

AB  - The conventional mathematical models that are used for traffic distribution and traffic mode choice forecasts consider neither the individual heterogeneity on the micro level nor the changeable traffic scenes. This prompted us to propose a new forecast method composed of a traffic survey, an artificial transportation system (ATS), and computational experiments. We introduced a BDI modeling method in the agent-based ATS. This method considers an individual's psychological characteristics in combination with logical thinking, which was introduced to individual passenger agents, to deduce each passenger's decision-making process when choosing the traffic mode and route. A series of computational experiments were conducted on the ATS by using a school bus system as a case study to validate the feasibility and superiority of our method. Several computational experiments were conducted to predict the traffic distribution in normal and abnormal traffic scenarios and to analyze the extent to which each factor influences the travel modal split. Furthermore, the outcomes of various vehicle-scheduling plans were predicted and analyzed by using computational experiments to determine the optimal plan and support the establishment of transportation policies in the real world.

The covered topics in our proposal include (i) the use of temperature and humidity sensors for data collection, treatment and visualization using Arduino and micro-controllers; (ii) Smart and Human Cities (SHC) and Open Data concepts, in order to lead the students to reflect on the problems of their city and on data protection. Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being. For the evaluation of our proposal, we carried out questionnaires and tasks observation. The experience was considered successful in its planning and application, with a positive evaluation of the participating students.

AB  - In his recent writings, David Deutsch has argued that no progress in AGI is possible unless a breakthrough in philosophy will occur - a new epistemological theory explaining how brains create explanatory knowledge will be found. The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems.

AB  - Its use in literary criticism might be one of the most novel opportunities to analyze texts and themes since artificial intelligence (AI) touches and improves every facet of human life. This paper has detailed issues on the application of AI-powered literary criticism and an overview of methodologies, applications, and implications accompanying the adoption of AI technologies. The paper starts with the context in which AI has actually emerged as one of the hot topics in literary studies, emanating from the crossroads of computational linguistics, natural language processing, and machine learning. “The true research opportunity that thus emerges from this work is the development of new AI technologies that can help supplement and augment traditional practices of literary analysis in such a way that scholars can get deeper into texts in search of the sorts of patterns and meanings that interest them. This paper presents illustrative examples and case studies in the applications of AI to literary criticism, which include sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and stylometric analysis. What these techniques afford researchers is a set of tools capable of processing large corpora of text with such accuracy and speed that identifying recurring motifs, characters dynamics, and thematic elements over genres, and literary periods is no problem. The following paper considers the ethical issues at the heart of AI-powered literary criticism, calling into question the algorithmic bias of authorship attribution and interpretive tasks it currently automates.

AB  - Every society has its own characteristics, shaped from time to time by the various innovative, disruptive, but in any case, dynamically changing mechanisms that affect it most. In today's society, technological innovation plays a major role in the development of individuals and their abilities. Education is the most typical and obvious arena for shaping, developing, and preparing for the challenges of the future. As in the leading sectors, in the world of education, rapid responses and immediate reactions to change significantly increase the ability to achieve and maintain success and thus marketability. As a sector responsible for developing the competences of individuals, building knowledge and training professionals, education should seek to keep pace with trends and break with traditional approaches and methods, so that, in addition to incorporating technological developments, a renewed approach to organizational development and methodology is an important means of achieving the desired success and effectiveness. In the course of our work, we provide a summary insight into the project work of student groups who require up-to-date IT skills, use advanced IT tools, plan, and implement their web development workflows supported by database management, front-end planning and design, and back-end programming with a project management approach according to the latest trends, interpreting the advantages and disadvantages of working methods for success.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) based learning system is a significant tool for developing the cognitive ability and problem-solving skill both in real life and education. This research investigates the reduction of cognitive load in CT based learning system than non-computational (NCT) learning way more accurately after doing a particular task within a scheduled training. But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before. To overcome this problem the ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a MATLAB GUI for immediately measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) based cognitive load individually. To measure the amount of cognitive load EEG signal was acquired from the two-class participants during the strategically question task and resting state. Preprocessing steps along with power spectral density were extracted to calculate the theta/beta ratio which strongly correlates with cognitive load. By seeing the fluctuation curve of theta beta ratio students learning ability can be determined. All these steps would be possible with the help of MATLAB GUI immediately by pushing button.

AB  - With the evolution of communication technologies, various substantial applications help the human community. Various real-time applications rely on the 5G era to fulfil the baseline service requirements. These 5G network communications deploy different cryptosystems to handle the security issues between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Here, a novel signcryption scheme is proposed over various public cryptosystems to secure communication among the 5G network model. The anticipated model establishes mutual communication among the certificate-less public key infra-structure environment. The proposed scheme works well against the chosen adaptive ciphertext attack under various computational random problems. A bilinear pairing-based signcryption (BPS) method is proposed and executed over the MATLAB 2020a simulation environment. This model is secure over the random model and establishes a better security trade-off among the prevailing approaches. Moreover, this model analyses and quantifies the scheme's performance with metrics like time comparison over a key generation, signcryption and unsigncryption. Therefore, the model attains superior security and efficiency.

AB  - This paper proposed an intelligent path-following control strategy that combines the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law and Q-learning (QL) for an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with unknown model parameters. The improved LOS achieves satisfactory path-following results for USVs with uncertain models, where the embedded QL method learns the vehicle model by the self-regulation of uncertain parameters to accomplish the robustness and adaptation for the path-following. Simulation results in tracking a straight line and a circular path are demonstrated respectively. The environmental effect of wave disturbances is also analyzed, which verifies the effectiveness of the improved LOS method based on QL.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Theory
The successful implementation of computational thinking into primary schools requires that primary school teachers feel safe and confident in teaching this topic to young learners. However, many student teachers face low expectancy of success and heightened anxiety towards computational thinking. Self-worth theory suggests that this may lead to a self-worth threat and in consequence to engagement in self-protective behaviours, hampering the successful acquisition of skills needed to implement computational thinking into their future classrooms.
Aims
This study aims to investigate potential self-worth threats as amplifiers of student teachers’ resistance to engage in computational thinking.
Method
323 student teachers participated in the study. Participants filled out a questionnaire on expectancy of success and anxiety towards computational thinking, and rated how likely they were to engage in self-protective behaviours, i.e., self-handicapping, avoiding novelty, and academic cheating, when learning about computational thinking at the start of the semester.
Results
Students showed heightened levels of anxiety and low levels of expectancy towards computational thinking. Further, they reported that they would be likely to engage in self-protective behaviours. A structural equation model showed that anxiety towards computational thinking was positively related to self-protective behaviours. Moreover, expectancy had a negative indirect effect via anxiety towards computational thinking on self-protective behaviours.
Discussion
Student teachers might experience self-worth threats when learning about computational thinking and engage in self-protective behaviours that might hamper their success. Our findings caution the impact of possible self-worth threats on teaching methods, thus influencing children's learning in the 21st century.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.
